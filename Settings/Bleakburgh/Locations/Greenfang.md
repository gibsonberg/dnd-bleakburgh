In [[Bleakburgh]]

Dilapidated old barn structures + run-down modern farming structures and houses
Nobody in sight

In  the center, resources have been consolidated around the larger industrial buildings brought in the industrial revolution. The buildings are still largely boarded shut and do not serve their original purpose, but there is civilization built into this (poorly).

In an active industrial building there is housed a massive cow-like creature tended by hundreds of people in some sort of hierarchy

Greenfang, formerly known as Greengallow, is a town in [[Bleakburgh]] known for its agricultural history. The town today is largely abandoned, save for the presence of the [[Greenfang Patrol]]. The majority of the buildings in Greenfang are in varied states of disrepair, with most being boarded up.

In the center of Greenfang, resources have been consolidated around the larger industrial buildings brought by the industrial revolution.

# History

Greenfang was once run by a group of people who lived by the land, practicing sustainable stewardship with their ancestral practices. With the advent of industrialization, these traditional methods of farming were gradually displaced by industrial agricultural techniques lead by large agri-business.

Since the primacy of the large agricultural businesses in Greenfang the town appears to have largely fallen into disrepair.

# Politics

Greenfang is administered by the [[Greenfang Patrol]], the de facto authority in the town.

# Sub-locations

## The Tavern

Near the center of Greenfang is a tavern operated by the [[Greenfang Patrol]]. The tavern structure is dilapidated and boarded up in a manner consistent with other structures in Greenfang, though it is fully-functioning. The tavern exclusively serves milk and [[Fermented Milk]].

## Underground Tunnels

Underneath the town of Greenfang are a system of tunnels that are thought to connect to various locations throughout the town. The tunnels are generally structurally stable through the natural load-bearing properties of the stone under the town, though they are unsupported and thus vulnerable to seismic action.

Within the tunnels there exists a room that is abnormally cold for its depth, which the [[Greenfang Patrol]] use for refrigeration of their milk-based products, including [[Fermented Milk]].

## Industrial Building

Elsewhere in Greenfang lies a large, seemingly-abandoned industrial-era animal farming structure. The [[Cow Creature]] is held and harvested within this building. Upwards of 70 people seem to be working in a hierarchical social structure.
