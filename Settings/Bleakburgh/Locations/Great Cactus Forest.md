The Great Cactus Forest is a region in [[Bleakburgh]] notable for its spiralling, twisting cacti formations. It was once home to the [[Cactus Hydra]].

# Wildlife

The majority of the wildlife present in the Great Cactus Forest are cacti. Bones of other creatures have been reported throughout the forest and on its periphery, though they have not been concretely identified. Furthermore, it is unknown if these creatures reside in the forest or merely perish within it after entering from elsewhere.

The forest is notable for being the habitat of the [[Cactus Hydra]], a large ambush predator that utilized light-based lures to attract prey into its clearing.
