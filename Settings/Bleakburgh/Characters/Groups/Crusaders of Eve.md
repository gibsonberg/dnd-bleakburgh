The Crusaders of Eve (also referred to as Eve's Cathars) are a militant religious group in [[Bleakburgh]]. They are the only remaining sect of the [[Church of Eve]] in the region. The Crusaders are an extremely militant religious organization most abundant in working-class areas of Bleakburgh, including [[Beatstone]] (at least prior to the [[Left Hand of the Foreman|incident]]).

The Crusaders of Eve hold the belief that the [[Void Cataclysm]] was a curse placed upon Bleakburgh as a result of human wrongdoing and sin due to the unfortunate and cruel ways it twisted the fabric of the world. As a result, they see anomalies as heresy and those close to them as sinners.

Eve's Cathars practice violent extermination of anomalies and those that sympathize with and/or use them, often performing unfair trials resulting in the death of those associated with anomalies.

The Crusaders of Eve reigned over [[Silverton]] with an iron grip prior to the arrival of the [[Harrigan-Penn Party]].

# Roaming Bands

Eve's Cathars employ roaming bands or hunting parties who roam Bleakburgh in search of anomalous entities and phenomena. Hunting parties are most localized around [[Silverton]], though they can be sent from anywhere with a presence.

Parties are known to take approximately one week's worth of resources with them, enabling them to perform expeditions to nearby settlements with ease.

# Relations

Due to their reliance on the [[Cow Creature]] for basic sustenance, the [[Greenfang Patrol]] fears the Crusaders of Eve. It is likely that in the events of [[2024-11-25 Religious Trauma]] that the Greenfang Patrol has been largely destroyed by the Crusaders.

The Crusaders of Eve are actively hostile towards the [[Silverton Resistance]], who sought to destroy the Crusaders' authoritarian rule over the city and succeeded with the assistance of the [[Harrigan-Penn Party]].
