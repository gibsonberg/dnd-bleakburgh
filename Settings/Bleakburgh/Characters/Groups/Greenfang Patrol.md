The Greenfang Patrol was the de facto authority in [[Greenfang]]. They are presumed to have been destroyed due to conflict with [[Crusaders of Eve|Eve's Cathars]] in [[Beatstone]].

# Relations

The Greenfang Patrol deems (deemed?) [[Harrigan-Penn Party]] their enemies due to the discovery of the [[Cow Creature]] and the subsequent murder and mutilation of several members.

The Patrol fears the [[Crusaders of Eve]] due to Greenfang's reliance on [[Cow Creature|an anomalous cow]]
for food and drink.
