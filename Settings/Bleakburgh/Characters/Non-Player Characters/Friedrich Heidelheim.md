# Campaign Events

During the events

# Appearance

Friedrich is a skinny man and is clearly harmless at first glance.

# Equipment

Friedrich carries a puny pistol, less capable even than the revolvers commonly used in Bleakburgh. His camp pack is fully furnished with pajamas, a sleeping cap, and other luxuries.

# Background

Friedrich studied for many years in [[Evaweide]] to become a recognized archaeologist. He has studied the Tokwa and their disappearance, as well as various [[The Void|Void]]-related phenomena, extensively. He is gay, and as such his time there is marked by Eveweide's homophobic policies, causing his fear of being outed while in Bleakburgh. 

During his travels in Bleakburgh, it is posited that he managed to survive his expedition to [[Wolf's Spine Gorge]] entirely through cowardice and/or common sense, as he is noted to not have much in the way of survival instincts or tools for self defense.
