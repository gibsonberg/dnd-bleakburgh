The Left Hand of the Foreman is a magical item owned by [[Fineas Penn]].

# Background

REWORK; SEE [[Fineas Penn]]

The Foreman had just gotten the latest report. That one company with the man who talks to spirits and always seems to get the good materials has a death and injury rate twice that of the others. Unacceptable. He was in the mines at this very moment, probably sealing some other worker's fate as they spoke. The Foreman stormed down there. Give him a piece of his mind, he would. He finally reached the spot where the kooky fucker was chipping away at some good rock and let loose. Then he fell silent, unable to move. The man turned towards him, and held out his arm. The Foreman, almost without willing it, reached out his own hand to accept it.

As soon as he touched the chunk of void-affected stone, he was whisked away as though drained through a strainer. All of him except for his left hand, which was held in place at the wrist by some unknown force.

# Effects

- If attuned:
	- The hand has 4 charges. You can use a bonus action and expend 1 or more charges to add 1d8 temporary HP. The hand regains 1d4 charges each morning. Only one temporary health effect may be applied at any given time.
	- While you have the hand on your person, unarmed attacks cause damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength. The target must perform a Constitution saving throw (DC 12); if failed, they take an additional 1d8 Necrotic damage.
	- Can cast [[Speak with Dead]].
	- Whispers from beyond the veil may be heard.
