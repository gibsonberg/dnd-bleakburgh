**Class:**
**Alignment:**

This character is intended for a future murder mystery campaign set in [[Arulon]] prior to the modern era.

# Class Considerations
Sam has stated that it's likely people in this campaign will generally be levels 1 to 3.

## Wizard
Might make more sense for an Intelligentsia bent rather than some other form of politician or lobbyist (noble, etc.)
### Schools:
- Enchantment
	- Hypnotic Gaze -- may not be super useful. Might be better for a detective character trying to ensure a suspect doesn't leave.
	- Would make lore sense to take on addl. Enchantment spells, which mostly deal with sundering peoples' minds
- Illusion
	- Enhanced Minor Illusion may be useful, may make a good lore device for why I'd be in the court -- could go either way with whether it's a known thing I do or not
	- Would make lore sense to take addl. Illusion spells
- Order of Scribes
	- Quill could be fun for conniving with written documents
	- Sentient spell book just sounds fun in general
- Divination
	- Portent.
	- Can theme the character around seeing the future in some way
		- Really lean into the mystic/oracle aspect of it for the court (Rasputin shit)
		- or could use it for political motivations/writing
- Chronurgy
	- Similar deal to Divination's Portent but I just force a reroll after seeing the result of something. Could be fun to cause mischief this way.

## Warlock
Charisma-based caster -- probably good to have for a murder mystery thing
Could really work with almost any background.
- If intelligentsia, could have stumbled across the patron through studies
- If nobel, could have been given an offer or something
- etc.
### Patron
- Archfey
	- Obviously thematically appropriate for the Imp thing going on with Arulon
	- The actual ability isn't crazy useful unless it's discreet but the spells that come with it might be useful and overall pretty cool?
- Celestial
	- Healing could be useful for a more benevolent Mystic type role?
- 

### Eldritch Invocation (if lvl 2)
- Aspect of the Moon (req: Pact of the Tome)
	- No sleep. Can't be forced to sleep. Long rests are just light activity
	- Can also just play a non-sleeping race if this is needed, or something like that
- Beast Speech
	- Speak with animals at will
- Beguiling Influence
	- Proficiency in Deception & Persuasion
	- Seems good to have for a murder mystery, especially as an evil character
	- Really fitting to Rasputin type
	- Opens up proficiency from other sources
- Book of Ancient Secrets (req: Pact of the Tome)
	- Access to addl. spells as rituals
	- Apparently can basically be used to replace several other invocations? Beast Speech, Eyes of the Rune Keeper, etc.
- Devil's Sight
	- See in darkness.
	- Can use magical darkness (Darkness spell, etc.) to get advantage on people
- Eldritch Sight
	- Detect magic at will.
	- Maybe appropriate for either learned man or mystic
	- Could also just use the spell normally, negating a lot of the utility of this
- Eyes of the Rune Keeper
	- Read any writing. Maybe useful if codes or foreign languages are involved in this campaign
	- Apparently can be done better w/ Book of Ancient Secrets or Ritual Caster feat -> Cast Comprehend Languages
- Gaze of Two Minds
	- See through another creature's eyes as long as you touch them and maintain it via using an action every turn/6s.
	- Get their bonuses to senses while perceiving thru them
	- I really like this conceptually for some conniving stuff, curious how useful it is in a campaign
- Investment of the Chain Master (req. Pact of the Chain)
	- Give familiar 40 flying or swimming speed
	- Bonus action command to attack, familiar's weapons considered magical for resistance purposes
	- Uses *your* spell save DC
	- Can grant familiar resistance to damage by using reaction
- Mask of Many Faces
	- Cast Disguise Self at will
	- Sounds like a must-have for some complex subterfuge?
	- Could be used even if not the murderer for character goal purposes (advancing a political cause, getting personal gain, etc.)
- Misty Visions
	- Cast an illusion without sound. Can move it and change its visual form.
- Voice of the Chain Master (req. Pact of the Chain)
	- See and speak through familiar.
	- Seems like a pretty good idea if using the Imp as a substitute for other invocations/as a scout
- UA: Caiphon's Beacon (req: GOO Patron)
	- Proficiency in Deception & Stealth skills plus advantage on attack rolls against charmed creatures.
	- More subterfuge stuff
- 

### Pact Boon (if lvl 3)
- Chain
	- Familiars! Special types, too.
	- Imp is basically the way to go for this by the sounds of it, if you want a scout.
	- Quasit can kind of be a worse Imp, but it disguises as its own thing if that's needed
- Tome
	- MOAR CANTRIPS from any list. More utility.
	- Could fit particularly well with Intelligentsia?
	- Could maybe appear as a Wizard to those not aware that I am a Warlock.
- Talisman
	- I just like the idea of being able to essentially give myself a free Guidance via talisman
