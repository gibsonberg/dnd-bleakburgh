**Age:**
**Race:**
**Class:**
**Alignment:**

This character is intended for a future murder mystery campaign set in [[Arulon]] prior to the modern era.

# Class Considerations
Sam has stated that it's likely people in this campaign will generally be levels 1 to 3.

## Warlock
Charisma-based caster -- probably good to have for a murder mystery thing
Could really work with almost any background.
- If intelligentsia, could have stumbled across the patron through studies
- If nobel, could have been given an offer or something
- etc.
### Patron
- Archfey
	- Obviously thematically appropriate for the Imp thing going on with Arulon
	- The actual ability isn't crazy useful unless it's discreet but the spells that come with it might be useful and overall pretty cool?
- Fiend
	- Spells:
		- Command seems like it has a lot of potential, fitting for a Rasputin type that has weaseled into the courts?
		- Blindness/Deafness
	- The rest is a bit combat-focused for this campaign, probably
- GOO
	- Fun telepathic, mental fuckery spells. Dissonant Whipsers seems good and could potentially even be used without initiating combat?
	- Awakened Mind -- telepathy in 30 ft visibility without need for spell or shared language
	- Overall seems good for a mystic advisor
- Raven Queen
	- Spells are okay, whatever
	- RAVEN COMPANION
		- Telepathically send it commands & receive sight/hearing from it within 100 ft
		- Adds CHA bonus to Perception checks & passive Perception
		- Companion in combat

### Eldritch Invocation (if lvl 2)
- Beguiling Influence
	- Proficiency in Deception & Persuasion
	- Seems good to have for a murder mystery, especially as an evil character
	- Really fitting to Rasputin type
	- Opens up proficiency from other sources
	- Can maybe just use those other sources
- Book of Ancient Secrets (req: Pact of the Tome)
	- Access to addl. spells as rituals
	- Apparently can basically be used to replace several other invocations? Beast Speech, Eyes of the Rune Keeper, etc.
- Devil's Sight
	- See in darkness.
	- Can use magical darkness (Darkness spell, etc.) to get advantage on people
- Gaze of Two Minds
	- See through another creature's eyes as long as you touch them and maintain it via using an action every turn/6s.
	- Get their bonuses to senses while perceiving thru them
	- I really like this conceptually for some conniving stuff, curious how useful it is in a campaign
- Investment of the Chain Master (req. Pact of the Chain)
	- Give familiar 40 flying or swimming speed
	- Bonus action command to attack, familiar's weapons considered magical for resistance purposes
	- Uses *your* spell save DC
	- Can grant familiar resistance to damage by using reaction
- Mask of Many Faces
	- Cast Disguise Self at will
	- Sounds like a must-have for some complex subterfuge?
	- Could be used even if not the murderer for character goal purposes (advancing a political cause, getting personal gain, etc.)
- Misty Visions
	- Cast an illusion without sound. Can move it and change its visual form.
	- This one sounds really fun to abuse since I know Sam would allow it and play into it.
- Voice of the Chain Master (req. Pact of the Chain)
	- See and speak through familiar.
	- Seems like a pretty good idea if using the Imp as a substitute for other invocations/as a scout
- UA: Caiphon's Beacon (req: GOO Patron)
	- Proficiency in Deception & Stealth skills plus advantage on attack rolls against charmed creatures.
	- More subterfuge stuff
- UA: Shroud of Ulban (req: GOO Patron)
	- Turn invisible for 1 minute at will (action)
	- Attacks, damage, saving throws end invis at end of turn

### Cantrips & Spells
- Cantrips
	- Mage Hand
		- Utility at a distance
	- Prestidigitation
		- Additional effects not covered by other Illusory spells
	- Minor Illusion
		- Kind of a worse version of Silent Image, although it does allow you to make sounds (it seems Prestidigitation might be able to?)
	- Friends
		- Advantage on CHA checks, but afterwards the creature will realize it was manipulated and get hostile in some manner
- 1st Level Spells
	- Unseen Servant
		- Normally not very useful, but maybe able to be used somehow this campaign?
		- Invisible human-like (but slow) servant
	- Cause Fear
		- Instill Frightened condition in 1 creature
	- Charm Person
		- Attempt to apply Charmed condition -- advantage on social checks
		- Creature knows it was charmed by you after spell; slightly better than Friends
	- Comprehend Languages
		- Understand any language. Probably useful in this campaign; written documents will be important
- 2nd Level Spells (req. Warlock lvl 3)
	- Suggestion
		- Suggest a course of action to a creature and they may pursue it, no downsides?
		- Really really appropriate for mystic advisor type
	- Spider Climb
		- Probably not super useful but sounds fun to me to just be walking on the ceiling
	- Invisibility
	- Borrowed Knowledge
		- Gain proficiency in a skill you don't have it in temporarily
	- Darkness
		- To be used with Invocation Devil's Sight or with Imp Pact Familiar

### Stats
- STR
	- Dumpz
- DEX
	- Need for AC and probably some skills
- CON
	- No skills under this, mostly important under normal circumstances for survivability.
	- May still need for some checks but not super important
	- Probably semi-dump
- INT
	- Some important skills under this.
- WIS
	- Normally okay to dump, but in this campaign may be useful for skill checks
		- At least in prior campaign, Sam often uses Perception, etc.
- CHA
	- Obviously max this out in whatever way you can

Overall, I'd say CHA > WIS = INT > DEX = CON > STR for this playthrough?

### Pact Boon (if lvl 3)
- Chain
	- Familiars! Special types, too.
	- Imp is basically the way to go for this by the sounds of it, if you want a scout.
	- Quasit can kind of be a worse Imp, but it disguises as its own thing if that's needed
- Tome
	- MOAR CANTRIPS from any list. More utility.
	- Could fit particularly well with Intelligentsia?
	- Could maybe appear as a Wizard to those not aware that I am a Warlock.
- Talisman
	- I just like the idea of being able to essentially give myself a free Guidance via talisman

### Feats?
- Metamagic Adept
	- Heightened (disadvantage for target of spells making saves)
	- Subtle (no verbal/somatic components)
