# Characters

[[Fineas Penn|You]]
- [ ] Want to know more about the condition.
	- [ ] How far will it go?

		- [ ] Death and life are so much more complex than I had previously understood.
	- [ ] Want to know more about the hand.

# Locations

[[Greenfang]]
- [ ] Investigate/free the [[Cow Creature]].

		- [x] Nobody is here. What happened?
			- [x] The illness spread.
	- [ ] Nothing remains but the mushroom.
- [ ] The Quarry
	- [ ] The Mushroom
		- [ ] What did Eve's Cathars want with the mushroom in the quarry?
		- [ ] The mushroom is still alive but weakened.
		- [ ] I must fight the mushroom. I must prevent the world it showed me from coming to pass, or fix it if it already has.

[[Sundance]]
- [ ] Need to find Lark a good school.
- [ ] There was a hooded figure in the waiting room of the doctor's office as we left.
- [ ] Want to find a realtor to inquire about home prices in Sundance after the last few years I have been gone
- [ ] I want to ask the wise man if he has seen Darton.

[[Darton]]
- [ ] I must go to Darton to find the source of power and rewrite the world.
	- [ ] How do I get there?
		- [ ] It's on the other end of the region. Not near Beatstone or Silverton.
		- [ ] Can I convince the party?
		- [ ] Can I convince Eve's Cathars to bring us near?
	- [ ] Can I make it through the anti-life zone?
		- [ ] CAN WE SEND MEGAN IN?????
		- [ ] Will I be able to see the Zone? Will I know its effects they happen?
			- [ ] I would have seen it in the Mushroom Visions -- ask Sam if it's gradual or sudden.
		- [ ] 5 tests, in order. If each succeeds, continue to the next.
			- [ ] **Test 1, The Canary:** Lead traveling party with a living being, in case the zone is not visually obvious. When it suffers, we have clearly entered it. This serves the dual purpose of testing the effects of the anti-life zone, and ensuring we don't accidentally cross it.
				- [ ] What will be The Canary? It should probably be something small and weak in case the Zone kills smaller beings first.
				- [ ] Expect: the creature to die, or undergo dramatic physical damage.
			- [ ] **Test 2, The Control:** Cause something completely inanimate, like a rock, to enter. Make sure it doesn't adversely affect nonliving matter.
				- [ ] Any inorganic item will do.
				- [ ] Expect: Inorganic matter is unaffected.
			- [ ] **Test 3, The Placebo:** Cause something once alive but now dead to enter. Make sure it doesn't adversely affect dead organic matter.
				- [ ] We will have to bring something dead. Will animal-based rations do?
				- [ ] Expect: Dead organic matter is unaffected:
			- [ ] **Test 4, The Proxy:** Push a part of the [[Left Hand of the Foreman]] through it. This is matter that is not quite alive, not quite dead. It came from the same event as me, and therefore we may have something in common.
				- [ ] Do not push all of it through at first. We don't want to lose it prematurely.
				- [ ] Expect: The Hand is unaffected.
			- [ ] **Test 5, The Deadman:** Enter. Death and life is more than I can comprehend, and I am not simply living. If the Hand can enter unscathed, maybe I can too. I may be the only one who has any chance.
				- [ ] Expect: I can enter unharmed.
		- [ ] If tests 1-4 end in failure, what then? What is Plan B?
			- [ ] **Test 1, The Canary Lives:** The zone is not functioning as expected. It may be inactive, or require further research.
			- [ ] **Test 2, Control Failure:** The zone destroys all foreign matter, most likely. There is nothing here for me while it remains. Find a way to take it down.
			- [ ] **Test 3, Placebo Failure:** Dead organic material is destroyed. Perhaps there is an edge case I don't understand. Tentatively, continue to Test 4.
			- [ ] **Test 4, Proxy Failure:** This is the most similar item to me, and it is destroyed.. It is unlikely I will survive transiting the zone.
	- [ ] How do I find the source of power once I am there?
		- [ ] Before entering, have a spellcaster cast Locate Object? (may not apply)
		- [ ] Do I know what I'm looking for?
		- [ ] Do I know where it is?
			- [ ] Do I know how to get there?
	- [ ] Do I know how to use the power?
		- [ ] I assume I can simply touch it like other great powers I've experienced before.
		- [ ] If I cannot use it I must have its use identified
			- [ ] Learn how to identify it myself.
			- [ ] Bring it out of the Zone to have it identified.
				- [ ] Hopefully the Zone doesn't move with it.
	- [ ] I must use the power to rewrite reality.
		- [ ] I must prevent the world that would have come to pass.
			- [ ] I must eliminate the mushroom.
		- [ ] I must bring about a utopia of my own vision. I have seen all.
			- [ ] Reverse the anti-life zone around Darton.
			- [ ] Restore Beatstone.
			- [ ] End material want throughout Bleakburgh.
			- [ ] Find the Chrono Kid for Lark
				- [ ] and/or directly fix the time loop around his house
