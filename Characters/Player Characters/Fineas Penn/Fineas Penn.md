## Meeting Pony Harrigan

Upon arriving in [[Sundance]], I immediately took to warming a seat in a local tavern in search of whatever local work I could find. Mostly, manual labor and bodyguard work kept me earning enough to live and drink. Occasionally someone knew about my knack for detecting the void and would have me verify if something had been altered by it in some way.

This time, it was a bit of all three. Pony Harrigan walked in, spoke to the barkeep, and was pointed towards me. Pony clanked down into the seat nearest him and waved me over. He needed some muscle to help him find something - he didn't tell me what it was exactly, but it sounded magical by the way he talked about it and how I was the man for the job. He offered money up front, and asked me to name my price. I asked for 25 GP and he agreed on the spot. So we got to searching. We headed right out to the Great Cactus Forest.

# Appearance

Fineas is a large man in both dimensions. He is muscled, not through any particular training, but from labor. He's shaved bald, with bushy eyebrows and a bushier mustache. Stubble covers his chin. His eyes are a pale blue.

When entering a rage, his eyes seem to glaze over in a misty white. His veins begin to visibly glow purple.

# Equipment

- [[Left Hand of the Foreman]], carried in a bag around Fineas' waist.

# Background

## Early Life

Fineas was born in [[Sundance]] in the year XXXX to a stonemason father and a mother who ran the counter for a local hotel. While his father mostly did utilitarian work, cutting blocks of stone to be used in local construction, he spent his spare time carving scrap materials into figurines and small sculptures. Most of these went to sale as a manner of getting some supplemental income, but every so often he would gift one to Fineas instead. Occasionally Fineas would hang around the hotel while his mother managed lodgers and assisted with finances.

When Fineas was 12 years old, his younger sister, [[Maisie Penn|Maisie]] was born. Their mother died during childbirth, leaving their father as the sole person supporting the family. Fineas would occasionally find miscellaneous work around town or help his father with the masonry, but it was not a major contribution to the family finances.

Not long after Fineas turned 17, his father caught pneumonia and died while bedridden. This left the burden of caring for Maisie entirely on Fineas. It worked for a while; Fineas had learned enough from watching and working with his father to be somewhat competent at stonecutting. He, too, was able to sell toys and art on the side. It was not to last, however. Fineas did not quite have the skill of his father, and work started to dry up in Sundance regardless of his skills. He was outcompeted.

Now without reliable work, Fineas turned to odd jobs around Sundance. It kept them fed, but no more and not with consistency. Seeking work with some semblance of reliability, he was eventually lead to [[Beatstone]].

## Beatstone

Beatstone was attractive to Fineas for its mining industry. This was a job he had some familiarity with; though he never learned the finer aspects of his father's craft, observing him cut the stone gave him a keen eye for mining. And while the work was not perfectly regular -- there were always more workers than work to be done -- Fineas often found himself chosen for crew because of it. Fineas started off mining common metal ores for meager wages. As Maisie grew and her needs with her, Fineas found the need to take on higher-paying jobs mining for [[The Void|Void]]-altered materials.

---

REWORK; SEE CONDITION

Work involving mining Void-altered materials was the most lucrative, as people were willing to pay a pretty penny to get their hands on it for weapons research and the like. But this was not without reason; Void-altered resources were also the most dangerous. If you were lucky, you'd lay your hands on the wrong deposit and simply cease to exist. Less lucky and you'd be left with debilitating injuries from who-knows-where, of types that not even the most trained physicians had ever seen before, and you'd suffer for weeks or months before eventually succumbing.

Fineas, on the other hand, did not suffer such a dramatic fate. Initially through luck, he managed to avoid death and dismemberment from the worst deposits. Soon, he became the longest-lasting void element miner on the crew, but with this time came an [[Fineas Penn#The Condition|illness]].

--- 

While Fineas worked the mines during the day, in the evenings he would try to sharpen his masonry skills by carving figurines for [[Maisie Penn|Maisie]] as his father had for him. The pair formed a close bond, but due to age and circumstance it was more akin to parent and child.

After several years of work, but before the void-material-related illness had fully set in, a 16-year old Maisie found herself upset with wasting her life around the mines. It was not hard for her to find work, but it was never fulfilling. Often, doing the laundry of other workers or selling what consumer goods she could come across by _varied_ means. Fineas never believed there was much more out there for people like them, and didn't know what Maisie thought they could possibly be doing instead. Eventually, this came to a head, and Maisie packed her things and left in the night. Fineas was alone.
## The Condition

11? years since Maisie's departure, Fineas had been stationed deep below the quarry with several other laborers. The team struck something unexpected. Picks swung and, instead of striking lucrative metals, hit a pocket of underground gases. They quickly dissipated throughout the mine, finding their way to the surface and propagating throughout the town. The gas produced a noxious smell.

As the gas escaped its pressurized pocket in the stone, the ceiling above some parts of the newly-excavated tunnel no longer had the force required to support itself. It came crashing down, trapping the miners in various pockets. In one of those pockets was Fineas and the foreman assigned to the team. With extreme concentrations of the gas in this small pocket, the foreman quickly succumbed to the effects of the gas.

Not only did he run through the stages of the illness faster than most, dying of respiratory difficulties in the dark, but he reanimated almost instantaneously. He lunged towards Fineas with cracking skin, and Fineas fought back. It took all his strength to do so, but Fineas won; all it took was taking off the foreman's head. A couple other parts came off too, notably, his [[Left Hand of the Foreman|left hand]]. When the rescue team finally uncovered Fineas, it was a grisly scene of blood and sickness and decayed flesh. Nobody believed Fineas; he was to be a murderer. He was quickly exiled from the camp.

In the coming months, Fineas experienced odd side effects. He was found muttering odd phrases and seemingly speaking to himself without recollection of what he had said. His veins would glow and eyes would glaze over in times of great distress. He occasionally had a cough or broke out in a sweat for no reason. But he did not become bedridden and die like those that would fall to illness in the town. Above all, he felt hollow; as though he was not fully human.

---
OLD -- REWORK IS ABOVE.

If his exposure to Void-altered dust had simply left him bedridden coughing his lungs out, Fineas would hardly have been a week's gossip, just like any old mine casualty; read off among a dozen other names of those fallen that week, with only an extra murmur for having gone in some supernatural manner. Instead, he was Void-Touched.

It started out mundane. First a nasty cough, then regular headaches, then muttering words under my breath without realizing. People would comment on it and he wouldn't even know that he had been talking. Eventually, he began to have a strange sense of the Void when working in the mines. At first it seemed like luck the way he always seemed to strike the right spot to reveal a vein, but it eventually became obvious that this was intuition, not luck; and soon he became skilled in recognizing it. As Fineas became attuned, it seemed that his blue eyes took on an almost misty character, especially when his illness was doing its work.

The arcane mutterings and strange sense for the void made Fineas the talk of the camp. With time, it seemed to many that he had been blessed by the spirits, and that my condition was to be so much more. Some took that a step further and even treated him as if he was one in human form. From them stemmed a myriad of local prophecies; mostly to the effect that he would oust the bosses with the help of the spirits. Whether he'd turn the mines over to the workers themselves or simply take the head as some benevolent local lord was a matter of debate among the most fervent believers.

It was not, however, a pure blessing. That muttering would become full-blown cryptic conversations when in close proximity to the altered materials in their raw form, and unlike before, with these Fineas was conscious of communing with some other power through them. Sometimes, those near him would say they saw ghostly figures guiding him as he placed his strikes into void-rich stone. It also seemed that his good fortune in finding the best veins condemned those nearby to hit the worst; casualties in Fineas' section were double that of every other. The gossip took a more negative character as the condition heightened and word got out, especially among non-believers.

At some point one of the foremen, who must have just gotten out of a bad lunch meeting, stormed down into the mines to tell Fineas off. That he made them good money, but they couldn't be having some "kooky fucker speaking with devils and killing their other best workers". Fineas had been actively chipping away at a vein when the foreman started shouting. Per the words of his coworkers, one of those spectral figures guiding his pick walked over to that foreman and held him in place from behind without him even reacting. He became silent. Supposedly, Fineas walked up to him holding his pick in one hand and a chunk of shimmering stone in the other, and offered it to him. The foreman reached out his right hand, and in an instant, seemed to be sucked inside. All that was left of him was [[Left Hand of the Foreman|his left hand]], held at the wrist by the spectral figure. The figure placed it in a bag around Fineas' waist.

He was confronted by the other foremen in camp around dinner time that day. Apparently, some of the more devout had taken that as the first step in his mythical conquest of the mines and had gotten rowdy for it; and, while they could rationalize losing a few extra miners, losing a foreman was unacceptable. Fineas packed his things willingly and headed towards his old home of [[Sundance]] in search of the sort of odd jobs he had become accustomed to in his youth. Without the constant exposure to the dust of the mines, the condition receded in some respects, but it is far from gone.

# Death or Life?

Ever since the incident in Beatstone, Fineas has felt hollow.
