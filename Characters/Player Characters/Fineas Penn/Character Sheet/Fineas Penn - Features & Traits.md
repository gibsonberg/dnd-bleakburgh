# Flavor
## Personality Traits

When I set my mind to something, I follow through no matter what gets in my way.

## Ideals

**Sincerity.** There's no good in pretending to be something I'm not (void perspective?)

## Bonds

My tools are symbols of my past life, and I carry them so that I will never forget my roots.

## Flaws

I have a weakness for the vices of the city, especially a hard drink.

## Languages

Common

# Features & Traits

## Class

### Fighter
http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter

### Fighting Style (from Level 1 Fighter)
**Superior Technique (TCE).** You learn one [maneuver](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:battle-master:maneuvers) of your choice from among those available to the [Battle Master](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:battle-master) archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice.)
- You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Commander's Strike
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

### Second Wind (from Level 1 Fighter)
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Barbarian

### Rage (from Level 1 Barbarian)

_Expend one per rage, regain 1 per SR or all per LR._

**Weapon Mastery:** 3 (? are we using this? look into it: [link](https://pages.roll20.net/dnd/2024-weapon-mastery))
See [Table](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian) for rages & bonus per level

**When entering Rage, pick one of the following phrases to mutter:**
[[Fineas Penn - Condition Utterances|Utterances]]

On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action if not wearing heavy armor, expending one rage point.
While raging, you gain the following benefits:
1. **Damage Resistance:** You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
2. **Rage Damage:** On your successful attacks (weapon or unarmed), add Rage Damage to your attack damage.
3. **Strength Advantage:** You have Advantage on STR checks*** (not attacks) and saving throws.
4. **No Concentration or Spells:** You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells.
5. **Duration:** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, or earlier if you don Heavy Armor or are Incapacitated. If your rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend it for another round by doing one of the following:
	- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
	- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
	- Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.
	Rage can be maintained for up to 10 minutes (100 turns?)

### Unarmored Defense (Level 1 Barbarian)
While you are not wearing any armor, your armor class equals 10 + your DEX modifier + your CON modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Primal Knowledge (Level 3 Barbarian)

### Ability Score Improvement (Barbarian)
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Reckless Attack (from Level 2 Barbarian)
When you make your first attack (we have been playing with this as each attack) on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you:
- Advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using STR during this turn, and
- Attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### Extra Attack (from Level 5 Barbarian)
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Fast Movement (from Level 5 Barbarian)
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

### Feral Instinct (from Level 7 Barbarian)

### Instinctive Pounce (from Level 7 Barbarian)

At 7th level, as part of the bonus action you take to enter your rage, you can move up to half your speed.

## Subclass
http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:ancestral-guardian

### Ancestral Protectors (from Level 3 AG Barbarian)
Spectral warriors appear when you enter rage. While you're raging:
- The first creature you hit with an attack becomes the target of the warriors. Until the start of your next turn:
	- The target has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you.
	- When the target hits a creature other than you with an attack, that creature has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack.
The effect ends early if your rage ends.

### Spirit Shield (from Level 6 AG Barbarian)
The guardian spirits that aid you can provide supernatural protection.
If you are raging and another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your Reaction to reduce that damage by 2d6.
At level 10: 3d6
At level 14: 4d6

## Background
### Folk Hero
http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/background:folk-hero

You come from a humble social rank, but you are destined for so much more. Already the people of your home village regard you as their champion, and your destiny calls you to stand against the tyrants and monsters that threaten the common folk everywhere.
- **Skill Proficiencies:** Animal Handling, Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools _(Mason's chosen)_, vehicles (land)
- **Languages:** None
- **Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a shovel, an iron pot, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10gp (20 GP BASE ROLL + 10 = 30 TO START)
#### Features
##### Defining Event:
A celestial, fey, or similar creature gave me a blessing or revealed my secret origin. (VOID TOUCHED, change?)
##### Rustic Hospitality
Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

- You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps.
- You have resistance to the damage dealt by traps.
- Travelling at a fast pace doesn't impose the normal -5 penalty on your passive Wisdom (Perception) score.

### Grappler

You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.
- You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.
