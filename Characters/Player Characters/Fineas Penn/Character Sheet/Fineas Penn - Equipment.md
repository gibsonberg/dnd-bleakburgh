# Special Actions

## Flask of Oil

Each holds 1 pint of oil.
You can douse a creature, object, or space with Oil or use it as fuel.

**Dousing a Creature or Object:** When you take the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing an Oil flask. Target one creature or object within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DEX saving throw (DC 8 + your DEX Mod & Proficiency Bonus) or be covered in oil. If the target takes Fire damage before the oil dries (1 minute), the target takes an extra 5 Fire damage from the burning oil.

**Dousing a Space:** You can take the Utilize action to pour an Oil flask on level ground to cover a 5-ft-square area within 5 feet of yourself. If lit, the oil burns until the end of the turn 2 rounds from when the oil was lit (or 12 seconds) and deals 5 Fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

## Rope

As a Utilize action, you can tie a knot with Rope if you succeed on a DC 10 DEX (Sleight of Hand) check. The Rope can be burst with a successful DC 20 STR (Athletics) check.

You can bind an unwilling creature with the Rope only if the creature has been Grappled, Incapacitated, or Restrained. if the creature's legs are bound, the creature has the Restrained condition until it escapes. Escaping the Rope requires the creature to make a successful DC 15 DEX (Acrobatics) check as an action.

## Tinderbox

Lighting anything with exposed fuel takes a Bonus Action. Lighting anything else takes 1 minute.
