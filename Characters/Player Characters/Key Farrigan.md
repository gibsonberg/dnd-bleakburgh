# Campaign Events
## Rumors
This is Key's first time crafting anything of a quality high enough to be used in royal ceremony.

# Appearance
Scrawny young girl, tall and lanky. Her arm muscles are extremely defined due to years of labor working on her craft. Her hair is in a variety of braids, pinned up haphazardly for practicality. It is knotted and messy. She wears welding goggles and is soot-marked by welding ashes. When nervous, she becomes extremely pallid.
# Equipment
\[ Brief description of any notable wares/weapons/armor/tools/etc. used by the character ]

# Background
Father: [[Sioan Farrigan]]
Companion: [[Penny Farrigan]] (construct cow)
Attendant: [[Saorise]]
The [[Farrigan Family]] was not mentioned in [[Morgan Crane]]'s speech prior to the unveiling of the knife. It is possible that they are a relatively minor family.
