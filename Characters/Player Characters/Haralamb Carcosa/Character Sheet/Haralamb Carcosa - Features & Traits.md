**CHOICE:** [[Haralamb Carcosa - Features & Traits#Archfey Patron|Archfey Patron]]

#### Pact Magic
Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.
##### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the [warlock spell list](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:warlock). You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.
##### Spell Slots
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell _[witch bolt](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:witch-bolt)_, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.
##### Spells Known of 1st Level or Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the [warlock spell list](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:warlock).

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
##### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
##### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

#### Eldritch Invocations (Level 2)
In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed [Eldritch Invocations](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/warlock:eldritch-invocations), fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

##### Beguiling Influence
You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.
##### Misty Visions
You can cast [[Silent Image]] at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.

#### Pact Boon (Level 3)
At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.
##### Pact of the Talisman
- Your patron gives you an amulet, a talisman that can aid the wearer when the need is great. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the roll into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.
	- CHARGES: 2 (2 max)
- If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet. The talisman turns to ash when you die.

#### Ability Score Improvement (Level 4, 8, 12, 16, 19)
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
LEVEL 4: ? Feat, https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:metamagic-adept OR +2 CHA

## Subclass
### Archfey Patron
https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/warlock:archfey
#### Expanded Spell List
The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.
- 1st Level: Faerie Fire, Sleep
- 2nd Level: Calm Emotions, Phantasmal Force
- 3rd Level: Blink, Plant Growth
- 4th Level: Dominate Beast, Greater Invisibility
- 5th Level: Dominate Person, Seeming
#### Fey Presence
Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.
- **Charmed:**
	- A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.
	- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.
- **Frightened:**
	- A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
	- The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Background
### Far Traveler
https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/background:far-traveler
You are from a distant place, one so remote that few of the common folk in the North realize that it exists, and chances are good that even if some people you meet have heard of your homeland, they know merely the name and perhaps a few outrageous stories.
**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Perception
**Tool Proficiencies:** Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland
**Languages:** Any one of your choice.
**Equipment:**
- One set of traveler's clothes
- Any one musical instrument or gaming set your are proficient with: PLAYING CARDS
- Poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are
- A small piece of jewelry (10 GP) in the style of your homeland's craftsmanship
- Pouch containing 5 GP
#### Why are you here?
See [[Haralamb Carcosa#Background]].

#### Where are you from?
[[Evaweide]] (#TODO: VERIFY WITH SAM)
TODO: DESCRIBE THE STATE OF THIS PLACE. Place should be feudal in nature and have some sort of forest spirits.

#### All Eyes On You
Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.

You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.

### Feats
#### Metamagic Adept
You've learned how to exert your will on your spells to alter how they function:

- You learn two [Metamagic options](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/sorcerer#toc12) of your choice from the sorcerer class. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless the option says otherwise. Whenever you reach a level that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one of these Metamagic options with another one from the sorcerer class.

- You gain 2 sorcery points to spend on Metamagic (these points are added to any sorcery points you have from another source but can be used only on Metamagic). You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.
	- POINTS: 2 (max 2)

##### Metamagic Options
##### Subtle Spell
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.
##### Quickened Spell
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
