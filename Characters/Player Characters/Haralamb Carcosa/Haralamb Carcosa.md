# Campaign Events

\[ Brief summary of changes to the character/their involvement as a result of the events of the campaign in which they are featured ]

# Appearance
Haralamb Carcosa is a man of immense stature, towering at roughly 7'2". He isn't strong for his size; his torso is flabby and his limbs narrow. Still, a certain amount of muscle is necessary to keep such a body upright. His skin is pallid, nearly gray, and glistens oily in the candle-light. His long, greasy, dark hair is usually unmanaged besides being poorly tied behind him. His facial hair swallows nearly the entire lower half of his face, and only doesn't swallow the rest of him due to a strategic chop at the end to keep it practical. His eyes are deep-set, close together, and ringed with years of inadequate sleep. His robes are of cheap linen. If they are dyed at all, they are usually uninspiring colors; though he wears a vibrant red set on special occasions. They are seldom adorned with anything other than purely practical instruments: a belt, a bag, or a pocket, a sheathed dagger for everyday use, etc. He wears around his neck a pendant bearing an unusual sign (#TODO: DEVELOP SYMBOL WITH SAM).

# Background

## Early Life
Haralamb Carcosa was born Laurentiu Nita in the year XXXX to a peasant family in a rural [[Kallanda#North Kallanda|North Kallandan]] community within [[Kallanda#South Kallanda|South Kallanda]]. He had an unimpressive upbringing as a son of serfs, with likely very little formal education. He received some basic liturgical and magical education from the [[Church of Eve#Church of Eva|Church of Eva]]. He began assisting with labor for the land to which his family was bound early in his childhood.
 
Haralamb's family lived in Metsovo (#TODO: VERIFY NAME WITH SAM), a small inland farming village with several other serf families tending the fields of a local lord. Each family's residence was built in a small cluster at the center of the land, with the acreages used for farming and grazing surrounding. Several such villages dotted the lordship around the central manor of the lord. Common products of such villages at the time included grains such as barley and spelt, legumes, small amounts of herbs for cooking and religious purposes, as well as goat and sheep products.

Metsovo sits near the center of Kallanda, not far south of the cultural "border" between North and South Kallanda (#TODO: verify, is there a formal political border?). Metsovo (#TODO: VERIFY), as was common in North Kallanda, practiced a mystical form of the worship of Eva. North Kallandans generally believed in [[The Old Ways]], a form of magic, and the people of Metsovo were no different. Haralamb Carcosa took to this worship early on, and took particular interest in studying The Old Ways.

It is rumored that in his adolescence, Haralamb was successful in practicing The Old Ways and performed a variety of minor miracles throughout the fief to which he was bound. Rumored miracles performed by Haralamb include the conjuring of trinkets and ingredients used in faith healing, the calling of insects, and the spontaneous lighting of small fires. Haralamb achieved minor fame and a small following of local believers within his fief and the nearby free towns.

## Exile from Metsovo (TODO: VERIFY) and Kallanda
In early adulthood, Haralamb (then still Laurentiu Nita) and his following came under the scrutiny of local South Kallandan officials lording over his fief. The South Kallandan attitude towards the worship of Eva and particularly The Old Ways was one of condemnation, with heavy prejudice focused towards North Kallandans. Upon a South Kallandan informant reportedly witnessing one of Haralamb's miracles, the officials sent for his arrest. Haralamb complied and was summarily punished with internal exile within South Kallanda to perform penal labor for a period of several years.

Haralamb was conducted to a penal camp near the Kallandan coast (where?), and was primarily tasked with woodcutting and stonebreaking. After completing his terms of punishment, he was set free on the conditions he did not return to his former home. He was conducted to a nearby coastal town (which? TODO: get a name from same) and released as a free man with his meager belongings accrued at the camp. He quickly rediscovered his faith among a small group of North Kallandan residents and began practicing The Old Ways in secret.

Haralamb spent roughly a decade practicing his religion in secret, becoming known among followers within the town as a faith healer and a mystic. As his following grew among the clandestine Eva followers within the town, Haralamb began to use his influence to gain favor with wealthier and more-prestigious spiritual residents of the town. Rumors eventually began to circulate of an Eva-worshipping mystic cult within the town, with some suspecting Haralamb at its head. Haralamb once again came under the scrutiny of local South Kallandan officials and law enforcement as the rumors expanded to various claims of his meddling in political affairs and obscene rituals including self-flagellation, among other unconscionable acts.

Haralamb and several other followers of Eva were rounded up on charges relating to the creation of cults and sentenced to immediate exile and the supposed cult dissolved. The arrested members were given a month


## Bargain for Survival

HE GAINS HIS NEW IDENTITY AND RETUNIE THROUGH BEOLACHT'S WORKINGS

Patron Beolacht? This also serves as reason for travel to Auberin; I saw him over the sea and decided to travel there. I am uninvolved in the murder but this acts as good red herring.

In a dream, Beolacht tells me I need to be in Auberin because he is going to appear in some manner and that he has been kept away for some time. H

Beolacht
- Most powerful of the imps
- Manifests kind of like a demon would
	- Horns, skeletal ish wings with membranes, grotesque
	- Darkkkkkkkkk indigo
	- Looks like woodcarvings of lucifer
	- A bit like a demented cherub but as like a full person not a baby
	- Always naked
- What he does
	- The lesser imps physically just tear people apart.
	- Beolacht works a lot with madness
	- Lots of sailors tales abotu catching his madness while at sea
	- He would sow distrust among the colonies themselves using individuals
	- He uses people as instruments of chaos, but physically operates similar to vampires
		- Being able to turn into mist to creep under doors and appear in rooms
	- Fear is the thing imps delight in most.
		- Illusions, transmutations, calling upon calling swarms of things into the house and such
- He is not all-powerful, but is dangerous in proximity to mortals
- He genuinely does have favorite people, unlike most imps who just throw them around
- The pact should be more Luciferian in nature; give you what you want at great cost
	- You poor soul, you've been through so much, let me help you
	- Maybe he contacts you on a ship already heading to Auberin?
		- Cross through some bit of the sea where these dreams can appear to you
- His whole thing is kind of that he wants to reclaim Auberin, which is kind of his sandbox he wants back. Doesn't want world domination
- Lucifer, Magic Man from Adventure Time
- Transmutations
	- Magic Man turns a bird inside out
	- Twisted shit like that
	- Bill Cypher raising his hand and all a deer's teeth leave its mouth.
	- Relatively minor but nightmarish
- Drawn to you because youre already a bit adept in the sort of thing that allwos cult shit to happen; rumors precede you due to Goliath build

## Journey to Auberin

## Entry into the Auberinian Court
asdf

Warlock; high charisma. Through guidance of parton, a retinue could have been fabricated around me. Everybody else will be like, ah yes a sultan of one of the norhtern colonies in Kalanda has come to grace our presence and has brought with them a great shaman (me?). A variety of merceneries and such on this ship the entity has helped me finesse. I arrive and there is not quick correspondence in this era, it's hard to disprove and it seems believable due to monetary status. Welcomed into court as someone with some sort of mystic capability. Auberin is not unfamiliar with mysticism  so they are like yeah, I am maybe a powerful ally to the monarchy of Auberin.

Haralamb is not yet an important advisor at campaign start I don't believe but is seeking such a presitigous position.
