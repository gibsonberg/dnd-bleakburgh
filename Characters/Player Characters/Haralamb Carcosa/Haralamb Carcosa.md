# Campaign Events

\[ Brief summary of changes to the character/their involvement as a result of the events of the campaign in which they are featured ]

# Appearance
Haralamb Carcosa is a man of immense stature, towering at roughly 7'2". He isn't strong for his size; his torso is flabby and his limbs narrow. Still, a certain amount of muscle is necessary to keep such a body upright. His skin is pallid, nearly gray, and glistens oily in the candle-light. His long, greasy, dark hair is usually unmanaged besides being poorly tied behind him. His facial hair swallows nearly the entire lower half of his face, and only doesn't swallow the rest of him due to a strategic chop at the end to keep it practical. His eyes are deep-set, close together, and ringed with years of inadequate sleep. His robes are of cheap linen. If they are dyed at all, they are usually uninspiring colors; though he wears a vibrant red set on special occasions. They are seldom adorned with anything other than purely practical instruments: a belt, a bag, or a pocket, a sheathed dagger for everyday use, etc. He wears around his neck a pendant bearing an unusual sign (#TODO: DEVELOP SYMBOL WITH SAM).

# Background

## Early Life
Haralamb Carcosa was born Laurentiu Nita in the year XXXX to a peasant family in a rural [[Kallanda#North Kallanda|North Kallandan]] community within [[Kallanda#South Kallanda|South Kallanda]]. He had an unimpressive upbringing as a son of serfs, with likely very little formal education. He received some basic liturgical and magical education from the [[Church of Eve#Church of Eva|Church of Eva]]. He began assisting with labor for the land to which his family was bound early in his childhood.
 
Haralamb's family lived in Metsovo (#TODO: VERIFY NAME WITH SAM), a small inland farming village with several other serf families tending the fields of a local lord. Each family's residence was built in a small cluster at the center of the land, with the acreages used for farming and grazing surrounding. Several such villages dotted the lordship around the central manor of the lord. Common products of such villages at the time included grains such as barley and spelt, legumes, small amounts of herbs for cooking and religious purposes, as well as goat and sheep products.

Metsovo sits near the center of Kallanda, not far south of the cultural "border" between North and South Kallanda (#TODO: verify, is there a formal political border?). Metsovo (#TODO: VERIFY), as was common in North Kallanda, practiced a mystical form of the worship of Eva. North Kallandans generally believed in [[The Old Ways]], a form of magic, and the people of Metsovo were no different. Haralamb Carcosa took to this worship early on, and took particular interest in studying The Old Ways.

It is rumored that in his adolescence, Haralamb was successful in practicing The Old Ways and performed a variety of minor miracles throughout the fief to which he was bound. Rumored miracles performed by Haralamb include the conjuring of trinkets and ingredients used in faith healing, the calling of insects, and the spontaneous lighting of small fires. Haralamb achieved minor fame and a small following of local believers within his fief and the nearby free towns.

## Exile from Metsovo (TODO: VERIFY) and Kallanda
In early adulthood, Haralamb (then still Laurentiu Nita) and his following came under the scrutiny of local South Kallandan officials lording over his fief. The South Kallandan attitude towards the worship of Eva and particularly The Old Ways was one of condemnation, with heavy prejudice focused towards North Kallandans. Upon a South Kallandan informant reportedly witnessing one of Haralamb's miracles, the officials sent for his arrest. Haralamb complied and was summarily punished with internal exile within South Kallanda to perform penal labor for a period of several years.

Haralamb was conducted to a penal camp near the Kallandan coast (where?), and was primarily tasked with woodcutting and stonebreaking. After completing his terms of punishment, he was set free on the conditions he did not return to his former home. He was conducted to a nearby coastal town (which? TODO: get a name from same) and released as a free man with his meager belongings accrued at the camp. He quickly rediscovered his faith among a small group of North Kallandan residents and began practicing The Old Ways in secret.

Haralamb spent roughly a decade practicing his religion in secret, becoming known among followers within the town as a faith healer and a mystic. As his following grew among the clandestine Eva followers within the town, Haralamb began to use his influence to gain favor with wealthier and more-prestigious spiritual residents of the town. Rumors eventually began to circulate of an Eva-worshipping mystic cult within the town, with some suspecting Haralamb at its head. Haralamb once again came under the scrutiny of local South Kallandan officials and law enforcement as the rumors expanded to various claims of his meddling in political affairs and obscene rituals including self-flagellation, among other unconscionable acts.

Haralamb and several of the most notable followers of Eva were rounded up on charges relating to the creation of cults and sentenced to exile from Kallanda in perpetuity. The arrested members were given a month to collect their belongings and arrange their departure from Kallanda or face execution. Haralamb was able to obtain passage on the ship of a Kallandan sultan headed for business in [[Arulon]]. In order to do so, he needed to give up the vast majority of his meager wealth and serve as the ship's chaplain.

## Travels at Sea, Bargain for Salvation
The journey at sea was calm, but difficult for Haralamb from the start. Having never been at sea and already worse for wear after maltreatment by Kallandan officials, he fared poorly at sea. The calmness of the journey lulled the crew into a false confidence, and though weather stayed calm, the ship was blown north of their intended course, straying near Auberin.

Not long after entering Auberinian waters, weather changed for the worse. The ship met a storm, and with it rain and great waves. Haralamb was wholly unprepared and largely confined to his bunk. His sea sickness worsened further and he feared imminent death at sea. Each night, Haralamb prayed for salvation and safe conveyance to his new home.

On the third night, he received an answer. He had hardly fallen asleep among the ship's jostling when he awoke to a silent, steady ship. It was lit only by moonlight. None of his fellow crew members were in their bunks. As Haralamb rose to his feet and began to step towards the exit, a mist seeped into the quarters, twisting around the ladder as it fell. Haralamb froze as it pooled around his feet. He watched as it then rose and took humanoid form. [[Beolacht]] stood before him.

Beolacht consoled Haralamb. He was such a poor thing who had been through so much, and someone so faithful as him surely deserved salvation from this wretched ship. Someone so devoted to his faith must be granted a head start on building his next congregation. The awe-struck Haralamb asks who he is, and Beolacht only replies that he has been gone for some time. He tells Haralamb the ship must head towards Auberin, where he would appear at a later date. In exchange for Haralamb's assistance, Beolacht would permit Haralamb safe passage and aid in gathering repute in Auberin.

The specific terms of the deal are as follows:
- Beolacht's obligations:
	- Beolacht would act as Haralamb's Patron, granting him supernatural abilities which would aid him in influencing those he met in Auberin.
	- Beolacht would ensure the crew did not recall Haralamb's birth name, only referring to him as "Chaplain".
	- Beolacht would dispel the turbulent weather and do everything within his power to ensure the ship's journey remained safe while headed towards Auberin.
	- Beolacht would ensure the crew is particularly susceptible to Haralamb's influence until he found entry in the court in Auberin.
- Haralamb's obligations:
	- Haralamb would act as Beolacht's beneficiary, answering to him when necessary through his dreams while continuing to from his magic.
	- Haralamb would give up his birth name and never speak it again. Instead of "Laurientiu Nita," he would henceforth take the name "Haralamb Carcosa."
	- Haralamb would convince the ship's crew to fully change course for Auberin.
	- Haralamb would find entry into the court in Auberin.

Haralamb agreed to the deal, shaking Beolacht's clawed hands. He awoke again to a still ship, this time with sunlight streaming through the ship's deck into the quarters below. Haralamb spoke to an amiable crew

## Entry into the Auberinian Court
asdf

Warlock; high charisma. Through guidance of parton, a retinue could have been fabricated around me. Everybody else will be like, ah yes a sultan of one of the norhtern colonies in Kalanda has come to grace our presence and has brought with them a great shaman (me?). A variety of merceneries and such on this ship the entity has helped me finesse. I arrive and there is not quick correspondence in this era, it's hard to disprove and it seems believable due to monetary status. Welcomed into court as someone with some sort of mystic capability. Auberin is not unfamiliar with mysticism  so they are like yeah, I am maybe a powerful ally to the monarchy of Auberin.

Haralamb is not yet an important advisor at campaign start I don't believe but is seeking such a presitigous position.
