# Campaign Events

\[ Brief summary of changes to the character/their involvement as a result of the events of the campaign in which they are featured ]

# Appearance
Haralamb Carcosa is a man of immense stature, towering at roughly 7'2". He isn't strong for his size; he's somewhat flabby and unshapely. Still, it takes some muscle to keep such a body upright. His skin is pallid, essentially gray, and glistens oily in the candle-light. His long, greasy, dark hair is usually unmanaged besides being poorly tied behind him. His facial hair swallows nearly the entire lower half of his face, and only doesn't swallow the rest of him due to a strategic chop at the end to maintain practicality. His eyes are deep-set, close together, and ringed with years of inadequate sleep. His robes are of cheap linen. If they are dyed, they are usually uninspiring colors; though he wears a red set on special occasions. They are seldom adorned with anything other than purely practical instruments: a belt, a bag, or a pocket. He wears around his neck a pendant (#TODO: DEVELOP SYMBOL, ESP IF PACT OF THE TALISMAN).

# Background

## Early Life
Haralamb Carcosa was born in the year XXXX to a peasant family in the rural lands of a minor lordship in the region of [[Evaweide]] (#TODO: VERIFY WITH SAM). He lived the unimpressive upbringing as a son of serfs, with likely very little formal education, potentially only having gotten a rudimentary education by the Church ([[Church of Eve|of Eve?]]). He began assisting with the labors of the land early in his childhood.

### HOMETOWN
Haralamb's family lived in a small farming village with several other serf families. Each family's residence was built in a small cluster at the center of the land, with the acreages surrounding. Several such villages dotted the lordship around the central manor of the lord.

Among the peasantry of the region, there was a common legend (DESCRIBE THE BEIGN WITH WHICH HARALAMB MADE HIS PACT)
