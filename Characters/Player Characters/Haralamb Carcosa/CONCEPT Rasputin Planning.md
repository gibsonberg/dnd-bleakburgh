This character is intended for a future murder mystery campaign set in [[Arulon]] prior to the modern era.

Rough outline of backstory:
- Born in the hinterlands of (insert place, probably edaweide) to a peasant family
- Some event forces him to flee into the wilderness (equivalent of black forest deal?)
- In his desperateness, he makes a deal with his patron (GOO, Archfey)
	- This can be like a classic fairy tale sort of thing.
		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearskin_(German_fairy_tale)
	- e.g. he is starving and hears lilted music in the woods and comes across a fey feast; he awakens in an unknown realm and makes a deal with the king there (Carcosa), etc
		- Maybe he falls asleep next to a lake and wakes up in a fey realm or something, and makes a deal with the fey there
		- Maybe there is a "forest guardian" a la Leshy which one is supposed to appease or pray to prior to entering the forest but some event (invasion, etc.) forced him to enter the forest without doing it first, leading to needing to bargain with the guardian for safe passage
	- His deal allows him to survive and grants him his abilities, but of course there must be some other end of the bargain. What does the patron get out of this?
- He survives in the wilderness and makes his way to civilization
- With his newfound abilities he is able to work his way eventually into Arulon, then the court there

Name Considerations:
- Romanian?
	- First
		- Laurentiu 
		- Nicolae
		- Artiom
		- Lucian
		- Traian
		- Haralamb
	- Nickname?
		- Yefi (? can this be short for some other name? Mystery?)
		- 
	- Last
		- Mihai
		- Ionescu
		- Nita
		- Cosovei
		- Draghici
		- Carcosa (see: The King In Yellow)
- Drafts:
	- Haralamb Mihai
		- "Harry" by the court?
	- Haralamb Carcosa
	- Laurentiu Draghici
- May want two names: one publicly given and one that is his actual name even if it doesn't come up

----------

# Class Considerations
Sam has stated that it's likely people in this campaign will generally be levels 1 to 3.

## Warlock
Charisma-based caster -- probably good to have for a murder mystery thing
Could really work with almost any background.
- If intelligentsia, could have stumbled across the patron through studies
- If nobel, could have been given an offer or something
- etc.
### Patron
- ***Archfey***
	- Obviously thematically appropriate for the Imp thing going on with Arulon
- GOO
	- Fun telepathic, mental fuckery spells. Dissonant Whipsers seems good and could potentially even be used without initiating combat?
	- Awakened Mind -- telepathy in 30 ft visibility without need for spell or shared language
	- Overall seems good for a mystic advisor

### Eldritch Invocation (if lvl 2)
- Beguiling Influence
	- Proficiency in Deception & Persuasion
	- Seems good to have for a murder mystery, especially as an evil character
	- Really fitting to Rasputin type
	- Opens up proficiency from other sources
	- Can maybe just use those other sources
- Devil's Sight
	- See in darkness.
	- Can use magical darkness (Darkness spell, etc.) to get advantage on people
- Gaze of Two Minds
	- See through another creature's eyes as long as you touch them and maintain it via using an action every turn/6s.
	- Get their bonuses to senses while perceiving thru them
	- I really like this conceptually for some conniving stuff, curious how useful it is in a campaign
- Investment of the Chain Master (req. Pact of the Chain)
	- Give familiar 40 flying or swimming speed
	- Bonus action command to attack, familiar's weapons considered magical for resistance purposes
	- Uses *your* spell save DC
	- Can grant familiar resistance to damage by using reaction
- Mask of Many Faces
	- Cast Disguise Self at will
	- Sounds like a must-have for some complex subterfuge?
	- Could be used even if not the murderer for character goal purposes (advancing a political cause, getting personal gain, etc.)
- Misty Visions
	- Cast an illusion without sound. Can move it and change its visual form.
	- This one sounds really fun to abuse since I know Sam would allow it and play into it.
- Voice of the Chain Master (req. Pact of the Chain)
	- See and speak through familiar.
	- Seems like a pretty good idea if using the Imp as a substitute for other invocations/as a scout
- UA: Caiphon's Beacon (req: GOO Patron)
	- Proficiency in Deception & Stealth skills plus advantage on attack rolls against charmed creatures.
	- More subterfuge stuff
- UA: Shroud of Ulban (req: GOO Patron)
	- Turn invisible for 1 minute at will (action)
	- Attacks, damage, saving throws end invis at end of turn

### Cantrips & Spells
- Cantrips
	- Mage Hand
		- Utility at a distance
	- Prestidigitation
		- Additional effects not covered by other Illusory spells
	- Minor Illusion
		- Kind of a worse version of Silent Image, although it does allow you to make sounds (it seems Prestidigitation might be able to?)
	- Friends
		- Advantage on CHA checks, but afterwards the creature will realize it was manipulated and get hostile in some manner
- 1st Level Spells
	- Unseen Servant
		- Normally not very useful, but maybe able to be used somehow this campaign?
		- Invisible human-like (but slow) servant
	- Cause Fear
		- Instill Frightened condition in 1 creature
	- Charm Person
		- Attempt to apply Charmed condition -- advantage on social checks
		- Creature knows it was charmed by you after spell; slightly better than Friends
	- Comprehend Languages
		- Understand any language. Probably useful in this campaign; written documents will be important
- 2nd Level Spells (req. Warlock lvl 3)
	- Suggestion
		- Suggest a course of action to a creature and they may pursue it, no downsides?
		- Really really appropriate for mystic advisor type
	- Spider Climb
		- Probably not super useful but sounds fun to me to just be walking on the ceiling
	- Invisibility
	- Borrowed Knowledge
		- Gain proficiency in a skill you don't have it in temporarily
	- Darkness
		- To be used with Invocation Devil's Sight or with Imp Pact Familiar

### Stats
- STR
	- Dump
- DEX
	- Need for AC and probably some skills
- CON
	- No skills under this, mostly important under normal circumstances for survivability.
	- May still need for some checks but not super important
	- Probably semi-dump
- INT
	- Some important skills under this.
- WIS
	- Normally okay to dump, but in this campaign may be useful for skill checks
		- At least in prior campaign, Sam often uses Perception, etc.
- CHA
	- Obviously max this out in whatever way you can

Overall, I'd say CHA > WIS = INT > DEX = CON > STR for this playthrough?

Maybe dump INT and provide more for str/con/dex for this character to be more rp-y

### Pact Boon (if lvl 3)
- Chain
	- Familiars! Special types, too.
	- Imp is basically the way to go for this by the sounds of it, if you want a scout.
	- Quasit can kind of be a worse Imp, but it disguises as its own thing if that's needed
- ***Talisman***
	- I just like the idea of being able to essentially give myself a free Guidance via talisman

### Feats? See if able to take any
- Metamagic Adept
	- Heightened (disadvantage for target of spells making saves)
	- Subtle (no verbal/somatic components)

# Race Considerations

- Half-Elf
	- Mechanically very good. +4 stats, versatility bonus, etc.
	- Maybe a little overdone?
- ***Goliath***
	- Gets the "naturally large" vibe I want across
	- Athletics prof. + counts as Large for matters of lifting ability, etc.
	- "Look like they are carved out of stone" -- natural pallor?
	- Naturally acclimated to cold and high altitudes. Can add some flavor
	- Can shrug off some damage.
	- Look into Goliath lore. Very competitive -- tally every win and loss? Could act as reasoning for looking to a higher power for advantage.
