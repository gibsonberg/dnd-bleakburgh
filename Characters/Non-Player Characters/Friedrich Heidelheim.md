Friedrich Heidelheim was an eccentric archaeologist from [[Evaweide]]. During his expedition to [[Bleakburgh]] to study the [[Tokwa]], he became a member of [[Harrigan-Penn Party]]. He eventually betrayed this party, bringing the fall of [[Sundance]].

# Campaign Events

During the events

# Appearance

Friedrich was a skinny man and was clearly harmless at first glance.

# Equipment

Friedrich carried a puny pistol, less capable even than the revolvers commonly used in Bleakburgh. His camp pack was fully furnished with pajamas, a sleeping cap, and other luxuries.

# Background

Friedrich studied for many years in [[Evaweide]] to become a recognized archaeologist. He studied the Tokwa and their disappearance, as well as various [[The Void|Void]]-related phenomena, extensively. He was gay, and as such his time there was marked by Eveweide's homophobic policies, causing his fear of being outed while in Bleakburgh. 

During his travels in Bleakburgh, it was posited that he managed to survive his expedition to [[Wolf's Spine Gorge]] entirely through cowardice and/or common sense, as he was noted to not have much in the way of survival instincts or tools for self defense.
