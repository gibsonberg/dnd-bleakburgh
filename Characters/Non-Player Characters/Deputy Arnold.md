TODO: BRING UP TO STANDARD TEMPLATE

Arnold is the de facto deputy of [[Greenfang]] who regularly commands a small group of armed members of the [[Greenfang Patrol]]. He is subservient to [[Bertha]], though often appears to take on direct roles on her behalf throughout the town as she has so far been sleeping or busy when asked.

# Campaign Events

Arnold headed the armed party that initially met [[Harrigan-Penn Party]] upon entering Greenfang. Wary at first, he decided the party did not pose much of a threat and possibly even had resources to offer to the town, which subsists off of only milk and steak. Arnold gave several party members tours of the [[Greenfang#Underground Tunnels|tunnels underneath greenfang]], and developed an attraction for [[Pony Harrigan]].

In Pony's tour of the tunnels, Arthur attempted to murder Pony for his knowledge of the [[Cow Creature]] as the source of the town's sustenance. Pony narrowly escaped, shooting Arnold several times causing the collapse of the tunnels over Arnold's head. Last Arnold was seen, he was limping into the factory that houses the [[Cow Creature]] after having somehow escaped the tunnels.

Arnold later appeared outside of [[Beatstone]] after tracking the party, resulting in a clash between the [[Greenfang Patrol]] and [[Crusaders of Eve|Eve's Cathars]]. While most of the Patrol seems to have perished, Arnold survived. Battered, he snuck up on the party while they slept. After a brief torturous stint while the party figured out if he was trustworthy or not, he was fully healed and accepted as one of the party.

# Appearance

Arnold is approximately 6'1" with an athletic but lean build. He has facial hair in the style of mutton chops that flow into his moustache, and his hair is reddish-brown. He has bushy eyebrows. He is known to wear a dusty denim vest with a pistol belt. Like all members of the [[Greenfang Patrol]], he has a piercing; his is a septum ring.

# Personal Life

Arnold holds an administrative role in Greenfang akin to a sheriff.

Arnold is gay.
