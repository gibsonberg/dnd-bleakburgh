The Mushroom Idol is a large, sentient, fungal being found in a deep chamber within the mines of [[Beatstone]]. The spores of the mushroom appear to be the cause of the [[Beatstone Plague]].

Touching the Mushroom Idol appears to allow at least some other beings to make contact with the Idol's intelligence. Though the mushroom doesn't speak any known language, through this method it is able to convey feelings, sentiments, and imagery to others.

# Campaign Events

In the events of the [[Dungeons and Deserts]], the Mushroom Idol served as a major plot point within [[Fineas Penn|Fineas]]' arc. The [[Beatstone Plague]], and likely by extension, the Idol itself, are what first gave Fineas' his strange abilities and forced him to leave Beatstone. Following [[Harrigan-Penn Party]]'s exodus from [[Greenfang]], the Idol acted as the pole which guided Fineas towards Beatstone. Upon entering the mines, this pull grew stronger and pushed Fineas and the rest of the party ever-deeper.

Upon making contact with the Idol, the mushroom showed Fineas a myriad of images. It showed him imagery of [[Darton]], both before and after its fall, and of a [[Darton Power|great power]] within which could reshape the world. It showed him imagery of [[Silverton]] under the totalitarian control of the [[Crusaders of Eve]]. It showed him imagery of penguins' knees, of playpi, and a variety of other nonsensical things that the average resident of [[Bleakburgh]] would be unaware of. It gave him further understanding of his middle-ground between life and death. It gave the impression that the great power was not to be wielded by mortals with such narrow worldviews. It showed him a vast mycelium network spanning the continent.

Fineas rebuked the Mushroom Idol, and, while its powers were reduced by [[Lark#Equipment|Lark's disks]], set fire to the mushroom. The mushroom was damaged but not destroyed, as Lark's retrieval of his disk stopped the flames.

# Appearance

The Mushroom Idol is a massive fungal growth attached to the back wall of a chamber within the [[Beatstone#Mines|mines of Beatstone]]. A mycelium grows throughout the space in which the main fruiting body of the fungus lies. The mushroom is connected via a mycelial network across a large portion of continent, and likely, world.
