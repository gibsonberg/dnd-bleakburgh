Chimeras are creatures present in [[Bleakburgh]]. They are mythologized as the bringers of children in a very similar way to how Storks are in the real world. 

# Behavior

Chimeras do not appear to be sentient, though they are intelligent enough to react to those firing upon it. Chimeras seem to ignore those other than their target providing fire on them until they deal a significant amount of damage, at which point they tend to adjust course to target the offender. They are capable of several attacks per turn, including a devastating breath attack.
