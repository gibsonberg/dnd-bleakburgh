\[ Brief description blurb about the character ]


Beolacht
- Most powerful of the imps
- Manifests kind of like a demon would
	- Horns, skeletal ish wings with membranes, grotesque
	- Darkkkkkkkkk indigo
	- Looks like woodcarvings of lucifer
	- A bit like a demented cherub but as like a full person not a baby
	- Always naked
- What he does
	- The lesser imps physically just tear people apart.
	- Beolacht works a lot with madness
	- Lots of sailors tales abotu catching his madness while at sea
	- He would sow distrust among the colonies themselves using individuals
	- He uses people as instruments of chaos, but physically operates similar to vampires
		- Being able to turn into mist to creep under doors and appear in rooms
	- Fear is the thing imps delight in most.
		- Illusions, transmutations, calling upon calling swarms of things into the house and such
- He is not all-powerful, but is dangerous in proximity to mortals
- He genuinely does have favorite people, unlike most imps who just throw them around
- The pact should be more Luciferian in nature; give you what you want at great cost
	- You poor soul, you've been through so much, let me help you
	- Maybe he contacts you on a ship already heading to Auberin?
		- Cross through some bit of the sea where these dreams can appear to you
- His whole thing is kind of that he wants to reclaim Auberin, which is kind of his sandbox he wants back. Doesn't want world domination
- Lucifer, Magic Man from Adventure Time
- Transmutations
	- Magic Man turns a bird inside out
	- Twisted shit like that
	- Bill Cypher raising his hand and all a deer's teeth leave its mouth.
	- Relatively minor but nightmarish
- Drawn to you because youre already a bit adept in the sort of thing that allwos cult shit to happen; rumors precede you due to Goliath build
