The Cow Creature, sometimes referred to as "Betsy", is a large (60-70 ft), anomalous bovine entity located in an industrial building near the center of [[Greenfang]]. The creature is incredibly large and has several grotesque features unusual of a normal cow. It appears that the creature is currently being harvested for milk and other resources by a group of several dozen people, potentially affiliated with the [[Greenfang Patrol]].

The current state of the Cow Creature is unknown. It is posited that the [[Crusaders of Eve]] destroyed the Creature after their conflict with the Patrol.
