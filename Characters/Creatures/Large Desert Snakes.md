Large Desert Snakes are creatures found within [[The Desert|the deserts of Bleakburgh]].

# Behavior

Large Desert Snakes form multiple-member colonies in shaded nooks within the deserts. They appear to be capable of burrowing into the sand and rocks, forming [[The Desert#Snake Pit|unstable pits]] which are capable of snaring their prey.

They don't appear to be actively hostile when not hunting, but are defensive when provoked.
