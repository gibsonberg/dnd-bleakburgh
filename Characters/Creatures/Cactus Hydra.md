The Cactus Hydra was a large, predatory creature endemic to the [[Great Cactus Forest]]. The Cactus Hydra is know to have consisted of several "heads" made of cacti and a light-based lure. It either inhabited, created, or was also composed of a large clearing somewhere within the Cactus Forest. The creature possessed some magical capabilities. It was slain by [[Harrigan-Penn Party]] in session [[2024-09-28 Prickly Beginnings]].

# Behavior

The Cactus Hydra would hunt by luring unsuspecting victims with its lure. It is reported that when [[Harrigan-Penn Party]] encountered the Hydra, that they fell under the influence of a time loop or other such event that resulted in the stoppage of perceived time, causing perpetual darkness. It is thought that the Hydra was capable of causing this state, rather than simply hunting victims of it, due to reports that [[Harrigan-Penn Party]] successfully exited it upon killing the Hydra.

Upon being lured to the clearing, Hydra victims would be compelled to touch the lure in the center. Victims would undergo vivid auditory hallucinations depicting either depicting that which they most desired or a traumatic event from their past. After touching the lure, victims would be trapped in the clearing the the cacti surrounding it as the heads moved in to strike.

# Death

The Cactus Hydra was defeated in battle by [[Harrigan-Penn Party]] during the events of session [[2024-09-28 Prickly Beginnings]]. During the events of the battle, the Hydra purportedly had an extreme advantage over the unprepared party. Upon making this realization, [[Pony Harrigan]] self-immolated in an attempt to fire upon one of the Hydra's heads, killing the Hydra instantly and nearly committing suicide in the process.

After the Hydra's death, the party reportedly was freed from any altered-time effects and was able to safely exit the Great Cactus Forest without further issue. It is unknown if the forest has remained in this neutered state.
