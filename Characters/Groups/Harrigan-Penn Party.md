The Harrigan-Penn Party is a group of adventurers in [[Bleakburgh]].

# Relations

The [[Greenfang Patrol]] considers the Party to be their enemies due to the Party's discovery of the [[Cow Creature]] and subsequent murder and mutilation of their members.

The [[Crusaders of Eve]] and the Party are actively hostile due to the Party's affiliation towards the Resistance, having worked with them to destroy the Furnace and their giant. The Crusaders and the Party are competing for control of the [[Darton Power]].

The [[Silverton Resistance]] and the Party share mixed relations. Generally, they find the Party hard to take seriously; however, figures such as [[Ainsley]] respect their assistance in dealing with the [[Crusaders of Eve|Crusaders]]. Other figures, such as [[The Authors]] find them difficult and rude to work with but put up with them regardless for practical ends and out of politeness.
