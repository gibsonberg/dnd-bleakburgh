The Tokwa were a group indigenous to [[Bleakburgh]]. They are no longer present in Bleakburgh following a period of colonization and industrialization by outside forces. It is said that they migrated to the north of Bleakburgh, continuing to exist in a clandestine manner as uncontacted groups, though this is obviously without evidence.

Historically, the Tokwa acted in relative harmony with their surroundings. From insight gained in session [[2024-12-01 Regression]]:

- The continent used to be inhabited by the Tokwa, who called it [[Tikana]]. They lived largely in balance with [[The Void]], which they called The Beyond. They understood that there were other entities within the Void, but that Eve was the most powerful and benevolent of them. The Tokwa retreated north throughout colonization, and today it is unknown if any of them remain, as any potential modern groups are uncontacted.
- The Tokwa built artifacts to serve as foci of the Void so that they could harness its energy in a somewhat stable manner. The Tokwa used these and a set of simple tenets respecting life and the natural order; these tools were not supposed to be used to do things that disrupt this order, i.e. for evil aims. Ruins are scattered across the continent. The [[Darton Power|item in Darton]] is not a focus.
