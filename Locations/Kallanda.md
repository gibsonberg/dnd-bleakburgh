\[ Insert brief description of the location and any key features/points of interest/history ]

!!! Evaweide colonized by Kalandans. The norhternmost coloneis in [[Kallanda]] believed The Old Ways (i.e. magic), Eve (Eva) (in a different sense). The southern colonies condemned those beliefs and they went to [[Evaweide]] because they felt they couldn't expand with the northern colonies in opposition. There is a place in Eden called the [[Sea of Broken Blades]] between Evaweide and Kalanda where there was a mad dash to make it to Evaweide to control that area. [[Guerrado]] also fought here. The northern colonies eventually collapsed due to the fact that technology could be widely applied whereas magic users were not ever-present. Those who survived escaped to an archipelago south of [[Auberin]] where there are all sorts of Kalandan ruins. In our story, northern Kalanda still exists and Evaweide is yet to be colonized. Northern Kalanda is more like a more barren greece today. Prejudice is brewing the North; the capital is in the South. Arts and sciences blossom in the south for a while; the northerners are kind of spoken kind of like the Romani; maybe a progrom type thing could be going on. Because the seat of power is in the south, it might make sense to be exiled just from there.
