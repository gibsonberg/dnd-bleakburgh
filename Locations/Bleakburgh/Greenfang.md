Greenfang, formerly known as Greengallow, is a town in [[Bleakburgh]] known for its agricultural history. The town today is largely abandoned, save for the presence of the [[Greenfang Patrol]]. 

Once inhabited by a group of sustainable stewards and later by major agricultural businesses, the town has since fallen into seeming disrepair. Dilapidated, old farm homes and buildings form the majority of the town's built environment. From the outskirts, the town appears deserted.

Resources have been consolidated in the center surrounding some of the larger industrial structures constructed during the industrial revolution. Most of these buildings are still largely boarded shut and no longer serve their original purpose, but civilization has been adapted to work with these remnants.

# Campaign Events

During the events of the [[First Campaign]], Greenfang was briefly visited by the [[Harrigan-Penn Party]] after leaving the [[Great Cactus Forest]]. The party originally sheltered in an abandoned building on the outskirts, but after meeting the [[Greenfang Patrol]], they were given permission to shelter in the [[Greenfang#The Tavern|tavern]]. After hearing strange noises and getting little detail from the Patrol, the party snuck out of their lodging at night to scope out the town, discovering the [[Greenfang#Industrial Building|industrial building]] containing the [[Cow Creature]]. The poor relations between the party and the Patrol came to a head in a scuffle resulting in a party victory. The party was forced to flee from the town.

The party later encountered the [[Crusaders of Eve|Eve's Cathars]] while fleeing from the Patrol's search party. This resulted in a conflict between the Cathars and the party resulting in mass chaos. The party was eventually given the opportunity to flee by the arrival of the Patrol's search party confronting the Cathars over the party. This confrontation lead to the near-complete destruction of the Greenfang Patrol, save for [[Deputy Arnold]], who eventually became a member of the party. It is presumed that Greenfang suffered harsh retribution at the hands of the Cathars, though this has not been verified.

# History

Greenfang was once run by a group of people who lived by the land, practicing sustainable stewardship with their ancestral practices. With the advent of industrialization, these traditional methods of farming were gradually displaced by industrial agricultural techniques lead by large agri-business.

Since the primacy of the large agricultural businesses in Greenfang the town appears to have largely fallen into disrepair.

# Politics

Greenfang is administered by the [[Greenfang Patrol]], the de facto authority in the town.

# Sub-locations

## The Tavern

Near the center of Greenfang is a tavern operated by the [[Greenfang Patrol]]. The tavern structure is dilapidated and boarded up in a manner consistent with other structures in Greenfang, though it is fully-functioning. The tavern exclusively serves milk and [[Fermented Milk]].

## Underground Tunnels

Underneath the town of Greenfang are a system of tunnels that are thought to connect to various locations throughout the town. The tunnels are generally structurally stable through the natural load-bearing properties of the stone under the town, though they are unsupported and thus vulnerable to seismic action.

Within the tunnels there exists a room that is abnormally cold for its depth, which the [[Greenfang Patrol]] use for refrigeration of their milk-based products, including [[Fermented Milk]].

## Industrial Building

Elsewhere in Greenfang lies a large, seemingly-abandoned industrial-era animal farming structure. The [[Cow Creature]] is held and harvested within this building. Upwards of 70 people seem to be working in a hierarchical social structure.
