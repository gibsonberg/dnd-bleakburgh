Beatstone is a town in [[Bleakburgh]] famous for its mining industry.

# History

As part of the local mining operation, mine laborers accidentally opened up a gas deposit which resulted in a noxious smell dispersing throughout the town. Over some months, people, mostly children, began to come down with an illness. The illness caused respiratory symptoms and fever in most sufferers, and eventually, death. Around the time of the opening of the gas pocket, [[Fineas Penn]] was caught in a cave-in with a foreman; when he was rescued, the foreman was found dismembered and dead.

The son of [[Jacob Gulley]] the town doctor was one of the first victims of this illness, succumbing after 2 and a half months. 3 months later, after reports of gunshots, Dr. Gulley was found weeping over the dead body of the boy. Gulley claimed he heard scratching at his door and then was attacked by the boy. The prevailing theory among the townspeople was that he dug the boy's body up in delirium caused by his grief. When found, the son had undergone severe petrification. Dr. Gulley's wounds, purportedly from this encounter with the boy, eventually caused his death.
