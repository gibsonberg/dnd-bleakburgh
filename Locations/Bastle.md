Bastle is a town in [[Bleakburgh]] famous for its lax enforcement of the law. While it is not a "criminal town", criminals generally hole up there if they do not want to be hassled. Bastle takes the form of a prototypical spaghetti western town, with a densely-built town centered around a Main Street with scattered houses surrounding. The town is home to several hundred people.

# History

Hundreds of years ago, the church built the town. When the [[Void Cataclysm]] occurred in [[Darton]], whereas some groups took the more militant approach of [[Crusaders of Eve|Eve's Cathars]], the church in Bastle stayed consistent with the original principles of the [[Church of Eve]].

# Sub-locations

## Town Hall

The town hall of Bastle is the traditional seat of government. It sits across the street from the saloon. It is currently occupied by the [[Raving Razors]].

# Church

The church of Bastle is a single-room structure with just around 10 rows of pews situated in two rows. There is an altar at the far end from the door. It is exceptionally well-kept on the inside by [[Deborah Jackson|Pastor Deborah Jackson]]. It is considered a safe space; while [[Raving Razors]] members sometimes visit to repent, they do not search for people nor commit violence within the building.
