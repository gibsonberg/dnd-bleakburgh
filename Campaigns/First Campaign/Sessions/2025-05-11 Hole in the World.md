Setting: [[Bastle]]

Previous Session: [[2025-04-06 Bugging]]
Next Session: 

# Synopsis

- [[Bastle]]: a bunched together central town, with scattered houses around in classic spaghetti western town fashion
- There's a man running towards us, arms flailing, seemingly directionless
	- He's dressed in a nice cotton sunday suit, dusty and tattered now
	- He's yelling for HELP
	- Lark nears the man and trips him with his leg
	- He's the mayor -- Mayor [[Jim Willaby]]
	- He's wearing a turquoise bolo tie
	- He's been threatened with a razor -- the person has a similar accent to [[Alistaire Hayes|Alistair]]
		- His name's [[Billy Brigg]] -- Alistair knows him
	- The group discusses "handling" him for compensation from the Mayor
		- It turns out there's several dozen of them out of a town of 200-300
		- The sheriff is currently tied up
		- [[Lark]] suggests taking the side of the mercenaries
		- [[Pony Harrigan|Pony]] suggests information gathering without Alistair
		- The gang is in town hall
		- There's a church of Eve that's mostly untouched by the worst criminals
- We decide to split into three groups:
	- Lark, [[Maisie Penn|Maisie]], [[Deputy Arnold|Arnold]], Alistair going to church
	- Pony and [[Fern]] are going to talk to townspeople in general (at the saloon?)
	- [[Slim Jim]] and [[Fineas Penn|Fineas]] going to town hall to talk to the gang
- We learn about a [[Time Loop|time loop]] of like a minute and a half of two people having the same transaction
- We head into town
	- The saloon and the town hall are basically on opposite sides of Main St
	- As we walk through town, people are careful of their belongings. Salespeople just stare.
	- Lark buys a bottle of literal [[Snake Oil]]
	- Pony tries to buy Snake Oil with two fake gold.
		- It actually works for once. There's a gold flake on his tooth
	- Part of the gang arrives outside the saloon, and they see some people with an ice chest selling beverages for apparently stupidly high prices.
		- Oh, this transaction is the time loop. Just as the tensions reach a peak between the people, the time loop restarts.
		- Lark tries to hold up his disk and it vibrates, not working because he doesn't have a charge
	- Someone yells out to Jim Willaby "WELL WELL WELL IF IT ISNT......."
		- "Awh... shitttt...."
		- Lark grabs his hands and walks with his group straight into an alleyway. It works
		- He redirects towards the rest of us standing around... "Who here wants to die for Jim Willaby"
			- He puts a collar? on willingly. Some sort of device that zaps him when he fiddles with it.
			- Lark notices it looks like just a metal band
			- The man says to stay away form him and his gang. They have a common patch: a piece of cloth with three slashes across it
			- They're called the Raving Razors
			- Pony asks him again and he threatens Pony; he walks further into the blade and calls his accent stupid.
			- I ask if they all just carry razors and they flash an odd hand musket with some such of belt ([[Seamus]])
			- Jim WIllaby gets pushed into the town hall with a lead tied around his band.. "Mr. Willaby back to your cage"
		- Pony rolls a cigar filled with cocaine.
		- Jim decides to make an entrance
			- Me and Slim walk into town hall.
				- There's been some intense redecorating: someone is strung up by their ankles (and has been for some days), occasionally being sliced by razors. There are shrieks throughout the building
			- We go up a rickety set of stairs to a mayor's office and see Billy Brigs sitting at a desk with Seamus.
				- He greets us. Jim says we're bearing business. We pimp walk towards him.
				- Jim and Billy have a "divine counsel"
					- Willaby is in a cage in the mayor's office
					- Jim uses Prestidigitation to fake light the fake cigar Pony rolled
					- Billy smokes a cigarette with Jim
					- Jim seeks men to help with the Cardinal, has some sort of offer
					- Jim unrolls the cigar in front of him to show him the cocaine
					- Billy wants something more professionally prepared
					- Jim shows him his supply under his fat rolls, throwing Billy for a loop
					- Jim says there's some peoples' debts we'd like to repay: Alistair
					- Jim says a "fat kat" (kilo) of coke is worth 350 platinum
					- Billy sees through the high offer; Jim counters saying it's rare
					- Billy says he feels insulted by the offer; could use some convincing with a lower price: Jim says 280
						- Nat 20; Billy agrees on the spot
					- Jim says Billy can take Al's debts from the payment.
					- Billy offers to take the brick for free in exchange for Alistair's debts, the Mayor's freedom, and the rights to not be hassled if we take townspeople
					- Jim counters with asking for protection included in the one brick.
					- Seamus seems like a wild card. Billy agrees
					- Billy offers 280 plat for a second brick; Jim comments that nobody has that on their person
				- Mayor WIllaby is freed.
				- Billy says Ali won't get killed on sight, but he can't step out of line.
				- *Billy does not know that Lark and his entourage are part of the deal*
- We cut to Pony and Fern in the saloon
	- It looks like a mainly-whiskey type of bar
	- There's a spanish-sounding guitar player in the bar
	- Pony throws a fake gold piece into his tips. He stops playing immediately. Pony swaps it for a real gold.
	- He asks Pony's name. He says George. He doesn't believe it.
	- His name is [[Luciano Martinez]]. Pony admits his name.
	- Pony and Luciano discuss how Pony walked in and basically immediately struck out being a dick. Pony's -3 CHA shows.
	- "I'm worried that you're going to be dead TOMORROW"
	- It's revealed that Pony is sober and Luciano is super cool with it
	- Luciano clocks that Pony is gay.
	- Luciano is an anarchist.
	- Pony and Fern open up about looking to take out the Cardinal.
	- Luciano mentions his grandmother is religious and worships Eve but they don't much like the Cathars
	- Luciano's cousin was looking into religions and got brainwashed
	- Luciano is like 37 years old, Bastle born and raised, and the time loop people have been around the entire time.
	- He discusses town history
		- Hundreds of year ago, the church built the town.
		- Everything happened with Darton and time started getting fucked up everywhere
		- Eve's Cathars emerged in response to these conditions
		- Luciano & his family have stayed consistent with original Eve worship
	- Pony tries to get a snake rock to play [[Freddy Faazbare]] songs; he gets a few notes
	- Deborah at the church and Luciano's abuela are really close
	- Luciano agrees to introduce the pair to Deborah
- The pair & Jim/Fineas reunite
	- Jim explains his dealings with Luciano and the Mayor among the group
	- Luciano offers to have us meet his Abuela; begs for respect
	- Fern asks if he knows Alistair; he only knows Billy really wanted him dead
	- He begs us to behave
- We cut to Lark entering the church
	- It's a small stone church, about two rows of pews 10 deep at most. The altar is at the end. No back room. It also functions as the school
	- "Fuckin Evers dude" is the literal first thing Lark says as he steps in
	- Deborah is writing sermons and notices them
		- [[Deborah Jackson]]
	- The rest of the group introduces themselves; Lark tries to stop Alistair from naming himself but he's safe here
	- The gang believes they can do whatever they want and repent and it's okay; the church believes it needs to be made up to the victims
	- Deborah recognizes Maisie
		- "What is this woman doing traveling with you all?"
		- "She's our captive; my friend's sister"
			- Lark explains what she was doing and how we stopped her and how we blew up the giant's area underground; Pony and Arnold's relationship and issues in the tunnels
			- He explains FIneas' following the shroom's voices and how we had to fight zombies in Beatstone
		- Lark asks Deborah if making someone undead goes against Eve's teachings; Deb agrees, and Lark dunks on Maisie
- Deborah description:
	- 5'5" black woman with braids around the side close and neat hairstyle, takes very good care of herself, half-moon spectacles, white robes
	- The building is extremely well-kept inside
	- Kind but firm gaze
- Back to the conversation
	- Deborah finds Maisie and the Cathars' actions monstrous
	- Deborah asks if Maisie Penn will cause problems for her or the worshippers  in her church; she does not answer
	- Deb gives Lark permission to kill her if she does anything wrong
	- Lark describes Slim Jim to Deborah as he's off negotiating for Alistair's safety
		- He mentions he's a god and a person and a cat and his best friend
		- She maybe thinks he's an imaginary friend
	- Deborah has to specify for Lark not to own people; Arnold has to corroborate that we don't and find it reprehensible
	- Lark is given a handmade book. He immediately decides to read it after being told "he can read it if he likes"
	- Lark maybe doesn't believe that people at shows don't think what they're seeing is real
	- Deborah starts the sermon and Lark genuinely tries his best to sing along.
		- He rolls a 3.
		- Nobody gives him a hard time. An older gentleman holds his book and points to try to help Lark
- About this time, the four of us enter
	- We play rock paper scissors irl to see who gets to decide our entrance
	- Kendra decides:
		- Luciano begs us not to embarrass him in front of his abuela
		- Luciano threatens the mayor? not to sing Freddy Faazbare
		- We can hear Lark singing along
		- We enter when the song gets louder so we aren't noticed and sit in the back and wait
	- Lark sees us entering.
	- We file into a pew and the song eventually ends.
	- Deborah gives us a sermon.
		- "Eve smiles upon you" *looks at Maisie* "well, most of you"
		- Go with peace
	- "And also with you Debbie!" Lark yells
	- People file out. Jim is introduced to Deborah
		- Jim does not know where he's from
	- Lark tries to convince Deb that he's the son of Eve but she knows about magic
	- Fineas hears that Deb gave Lark permission to kill Maisie and contests it but iterates that she won't be causing problems
	- Jim spreads the news Al has been freed
	- Jim explains to Deborah more about he's part God
		- He can talk to himself and his human parts when hes sleeping sometime
		- Deborah asks if he's familiar with the notion of the Companion
			- "No.. no not at all"
			- Deb says that Jim is a "beast" (though very lovely), put in the world to be a manifestation of Eve's will
			- Lark: Woah! You ARE Eve?
			- Deb says no? He may be some sort of Acolyte, a close follower, very close to Eve
			- "I haven't seen Eve in ages... she's not here anymore"
			- Lark: Do gods poop?
				- That's for bodies that have a digestive system
				- Slim Jim poops but just the cat part
	- Deb liked Lark's singing
	- Deb offers us all a place to stay
	- Deb acknowledges that some aspect of Eve (Jim) lies and has to grapple with it; Jim says it's probably his human portion
	- Lark speaks about how we met Jim in the Great Cactus Forest
- We are allowed to set up for the night
	- Al and the mayor are chit chatting
	- Fern goes to chat with Deb
		- Fern doesn't know how unique it is; she has a thing with fire and did worship kind of similarly to how they do and is curious if she knows more about it
		- Deb describes that there are many such figures that represent Eve that are thought to manifest; Deb has seen lots of people have fire magic
		- Maybe Fern is related to one in some way?
		- Deb says it can maybe be revealed through dreams. Fern offers to go to sleep right now
		- Deb says she should apologize to Fineas and explain what has happened to her
	- Fern goes to bed
	- Deb and Fineas have an exchange; Deborah apologizes and tries to explain her position. Fineas says family won't get in the way of her community if the respect is shared and that he will hold Maisie to the same
- Fern explains what she heard from Deb to the party
	- She had children who were killed. She worshipped Eve back in her mother country similarly to this church. That's how she got the goober. So she's going to try to find out if she's part god or something.
- Maisie is mumbling in the corner
	- Lark goes over to ask her questions
	- "What are you doing?"
		- "Praying."
			- Shes 100% lying
	- "Did you like the songs?"
		- "Wasn't listening."
	- "This doesn't seem that bad. Why do you hate this so much? (the church)"
		- She looks at Lark for a while then breathes deeply. "They're weak, Lark. Do you think that this saves anyone?"
			- "Al's not getting killed cuz he's in here, so that's one"
			- Maisie refers to the zeppelins coming and says that this style of church isn't going to fix that.
	- "But what you do is like, not letting people do things, which sucks more"
		- Maisie says they've bought two people today
	- Lark mentions the brainwashing attempt of Pony
		- She says he would have been more blissful for it
			- Why?
				- He would not have known anything but Eve's love
					- But his whole thing is knowing things; you're taking that away
						- He knows the wrong sort of things
	- How is doing this gonna stop the zeppelin?
		- You saw what we were building. Things like that would have stopped him
	- Lark shows Maisie the hilt of the gun and asks what she's actually doing.
		- She just smiles and doesn't say anything
	- Lark looks around for markings or anything; nothing.
	- Lark says he's gonna take first watch
- Pony finishes his armor throughout downtime in the church
	- The armor is made of chimera scales, armor, leather, ornamental gold armor, etc.
	- He's made half plate with the chimera scales layered on the shoulders, ornamental pieces from that armor set in panels over himself, leather hodge-podged all over the place, steampunk vibes. AC 19, +1 gauntlet damage
- Lark takes first watch. Waits in a pew watching Maisie and making sure everyone (especially Fineas) is asleep
	- Lark wakes up Arnold
	- "Trust me, I know I lie a lot..." Maisie was mumbling to herself and she lied about why... he doesn't want to hurt her, just tie her up and gag her and put his disks on her.
	- Arnold is worried she's gonna yell if they try. He's not convinced to go against Fineas
	- Lark goes back to Maisie.
		- She's not visibly muttering, but she has her hand around something on her chest that she does not move.
	- Lark tries to take the item. She doesn't move. "Give it" and he sticks his hand out and starts counting down
		- She does not show any response.
		- Lark covers her mouth and reaches in to grab it
			- A gold chain breaks around her neck. It's a circular pendant; the Cathars of Eve logo. It feels warm in an otherworldly manner; more than body heat.
				- "Dude.... are you fucking serious?" Does she see how much Fineas cares about her and how she's still gonna be a bitch, he doesn't know what she's gonna do but warm = fire/boom, was she really gonna blow up a church?
					- She shakes her head.
		- He takes her hand off her mouth and asks her if she was gonna do something bad
			- To endanger the church?
				- The disk on Lark's shoulder buzzes
				- No, she says
					- She's partially telling the truth; she wasn't going to harm anyone directly but people may have been in danger
		- Lark sticks the pendant directly on a disk.
			- Maisie had never seen the disks function. She watches.
		- The church is lit in a bright blue flare of light. The pendant in his hand crumbles to dust. He felt like captured magic.
		- "I don't know... Fineas really wants you to be chill"
			- Maisie is horrified that the disk thing happened. First time she has ever shown fear around us. She's less taken aback by what he just did but by the fact that he prevented something she was really trying to do.
		- "So... what was that"
			- A talisman. She doesn't answer further
		- "Fineas really cares about you and wants you not to suck. You're not doing great at that. I'm gonna take my watch and try to get some sleep." He blows the talisman dust into her face
- Fineas opens his eyes. I am somewhere I have not seen for a very very long time.
	- I am in a well-kept home. There is enough bedrooms for each person, ornate paintings, instruments throughout the house. My eyeline is much shorter than normal. I turn and see my sister at age 4. She's playing piano beautifully. I am at the desk of a stern man. He has a well groomed moustache, neatly parted hair, and a suit and monocle. 
	- "Son" I was told you were fighting in your lessons today. He looks to Maisie with perfect posture.
	- "I have done my best to teach you responsibility, Fineas. I have asked you to take the many gifts we have afforded you and take them seriously. Fighting in the yard. He places his hand against his brow. Fineas have never understood what it is to provide; what duty is
	- He gestures around. "I have in your mother's absence provided for the both of you. That responsibility will fall to you. After Im gone, you will be all she has."
	- He dismisses me. Yes sir.
	- We see pieces from my life further along. As father dies. The light in Maisies eyes grow duller with each town. I remember the day she left. I see a clear image of who she is now, how different she looks now strikes me.
	- The scene shifts, and I am somewhere much closer. I am in a very small, sparse main street. It looks like Bastle. It looks very old; the only thing that remains recognizable is the church, unaltered. I watch people walk through the town battered and bruised, daggers hanging and holy men. Someone with a bow slung over their back, with a snake wrapped around his arm (Bill McGraw?). They talk to a leader of the church. The scene shifts.
	- Someone with a pistol points it at the holy man's head. There is a gunshot and the clergyman falls. Someone's hand reaches out. He mouths "Darton". He wears a dust red shirt and a stark white smile
	- The ground opens up beneath me. Something organic, pulsing wraps around my calves, legs, upwards. I am rooted to the ground. I hear a voice, quiet in the distance lately. The sky is red. The buildings are razed around. Machines with a symbol in the palm of the man in the red shirt (Bill McGraw?) etched into their exoskeletons. Segmented machines with many legs stretch over the sky as it is swallowed in darkness. This is Darton.
	- This is the place Bill McGraw called an entity from the void into the material realm. This is the moment the world split. A pair of eyes in the darkness. They whisper, I cannot quite hear. I can make out one word: beginning. I feel that something is waking up in Darton.
	- Vision gets darker. Imagery gets further. An airship drifts above.
- Lark wakes Arnold for next watch.
	- "I told you so" and he explains the happenings of his watch.
	- Arnold keeps a close watch on Maisie the entire time, it goes uneventfully
	- She's still for the entire watch
- Arnold wakes Pony
	- He explains what happened with Lark's watch
	- "Imma go to bed"
- Kaw is asleep and dreaming.
	- He seems to wake up in a warm and grassy field. He looks down and sees that he has much longer limbs than normal. They still end in paws with claws, a tail, and so on but it's all so much longer. There is a puddle he looks into and sees the face of a lion.
	- He hears a voice he can't really apply a quality to; it kind of sounds like the breeze. There is a ripple in the water. He hears the shape of a sounds that says "it's good to see you my little creature."
	- There's a calm breeze as he asks "Eve?". The breeze makes him assured.
	- Eve is much closer now than when he was taken from them.
	- All of this language is more of a feeling than a voice.
	- "You are in good company. You are with good people. May I show you something? I cannot promise it won't be frightening."
	- He is shown a twisted shape. Two heads and contorted. Familiar. It speaks in voices to a stout little cat on its two legs.
	- It gives a command. It promises a destiny, of great things. Jim remembers this. A great shadow, a silhouette, reaches up and into the back of the being; like a limb stretching far off into the distance. Jim can't see from where it springs. Hand in a puppet.
	- A light goes out in the eyes of this being as the shadow hand pulls out of its puppet. It pauses and turns towards the perspective Jim is looking from. Fade to black and Jim is back, looking into the pool.
	- "A great many forces have brought you to this place. Unbeknownst to them, the veil is thinner here. They did not anticipate that I would reach you."
	- "So, they were trying to deceive me?"
		- "They were trying to guide you towards an end that they found favorable, that they felt you could be persuaded of. They will meet you with a choice and I cannot tell you what it will be"
	- "What should I do? What's your Will?"
		- "My Will is that you will know to do what's right for the world when the time comes. That you will play a part in healing this world, even if its in some small way, even if in the smallest of ways as when a cat purrs next to someone. Sleep well my little creature"
- Pony wakes Fineas
	- Pony tells Fineas about what he's heard through the other two.
	- I decide to sit conspicuously across from her and try to have some genuine conversation with her.
	- I apologize for not being enough. We converse a little. I ask her why she put up with the Cathars, of all groups -- why she didn't put in with someone else? Even thought they wouldn't have had zombie golems or whatever, she could have built *something*
		- She says that the Cathars say divinity comes in many forms. I tell her that's not a very good answer, but that's okay. I leave and give her spac.e
	- Maisie is feeling shame right now.
	- The rest of my watch is uneventful
- Fern is asleep and dreaming.
	- Fern awakes somewhere she used to pray. It is in a massive valley, untouched by people. There is something in the wind and sunlight here.
	- "You are taking good care of them. The littlest one gets into trouble. They're lucky to have you. You've met my little lion? The House is closer than it's been to itself."
	- Fern says The House is close but the Flame is needed???? or something
	- "You've,... named it Goober?"
		- "yeah is that okay?"
			- "Yeah. I Like it... it just killed a giant."
	- "He is an extension of you"
	- Fern is casual with Eve and Eve says its lovely and refreshing because most people are kind of awe-struck
	- "Is there anything I need to know or be aware of?"
		- Something... unfamiliar to Eve guides the Bald One. I do not yet know what his story will unfold to be. He sees visions that have not yet come to pass but that may. He may be turned towards other ends.
			- "So like, shepherd him in... keep him close so he stays within the family when we find The House"
				- The house is already here; it's something you've already built
	- "Is there anyone with us who's not in the house so I can draw them in?"
		- A lost daughter.
		- All of them have tendency to stray.
		- Keep them close. It may be some time before I'm able to speak with you again.
	- "Do I have to be at church to talk with you?"
		- No, but here the veil is thin.
	- "Is there a reason why we haven't talked lately?"
		- The wind stutters a little bit.
		- I am always here.
	- She awakes, feeling rested.
- We are all awake.
	- Lark to Arnold... You are like the only one other than me that I think might not be insane.
		- He thinks Maisie isn't remorseful at all and mentions what Maisie said about this church being weak.
		- Lark says that maybe Maisie doesn't deserve to die but maybe she does... he's having second thoughts about killing after all this church stuff. He suggests letting her go.
		- Lark makes Arnold swear not to speak on it to Fineas or Pony (since Pony talks a lot)
		- Arnold says they'll keep an eye on it
		- Lark goes further - no Slim Jim. Arnold tries to get Lark to let him not lie with Pony about this, he's okay with it, just don't tell Jim.
			- Lark says he doesn't want to fuck Slim Jim
	- Arnold asks to talk to Pony about something quietly over breakfast.
		- About Maisie and such
		- Says he cannot speak about it to Fineas, makes him promise
	- Meanwhile Lark relays all of the information to Fern
	- Everyone else in the group besides Fineas, Jim, Alistair, and the mayor discuss this as Fineas and Jim discuss how weird it is that they're talking together.
		- Lark and Arnold think it's worth abandoning her because they think she was gonna blow everything up
		- Pony and Fern disagree and think she might be an asset
	- Fineas has been hearing their entire conversation and walks up behind Lark, placing his hand on his shoulder.
		- An argument erupts about how to handle Maisie. We decide to have a talking stick because we're just arguing over one another.
		- Eventually, Fineas asks Maisie what she wants to do, generally, no judgment. She describes her role reporting on our positions to the Cardinal and says it's kind of a moving target what she wants to do. She has seen this other way of worshipping Eve and so on and is having a change of heart
		- Maisie doesn't think she wants to fuck us over.
		- Jim casts Zone of Truth and fails to obscure it
	- Eventually, we reach a somewhat reasonable conclusion: allow Maisie to explore what this type of worship is like and see what she wants to do with herself.
	- Deb walks over and comments on our Zone of Truth. Lark asks her if her hair is real. The Zone falls.
- Fern asks Deb if she'd be willing to spend some time with Maisie.
	- Deb agrees to talk to Maisie.
- Deb discusses the dreams with Fern and Slim Jim
	- "The veil is really thin and I am really gullible"
		- He explains that there are other deities puppeting the eldritch monster and such
- Deb goes to talk with Maisie
- Arnold goes to talk with Pony
	- He compliments him on his breakfast and says he doesn't think they've had much time to just talk
	- Pony says they've been busy lately; Arnold says he's trying to talk *right now.*
	- Arnold asks if Pony's been thinking about what's next after all this
		- Pony says he's been a little preoccupied with the potential battle
	- Arnold says "you haven't thought at all about it?"
		- Pony goes "no...no...nono" (dirty 20)
		- Arnold sees through it. "Uhm... nevermind" and walks away
	- Arnold leaves the church. Pony keeps following him.
	- Pony keeps trying to continue the conversation
	- Pony says he wants to think about it and he will, asks if Arnold has been
		- Arnold says yes, he thinks maybe there's a house somewhere or a dog or something
	- Pony asks what kind of dog
		- Labradoodle
			- Pony says they can't do that
				- Chocolate Lab
					- Arnold says that's a type of labradoodle
						- Pony says they're gonna get him a book on dog breeds
	- Pony suggests they raise chickens
	- Pony says he'll make Arnold breakfast every day and Arnold gets a little teary eyed
	- Pony reassures Arnold that he wants to be with him.
	- Arnold says that a lot's been happening but he also thinks its okay to think about after.
	- Pony apologizes and they do a little kiss.
- Lark walks outside and sees two latin-sounding kids fighting and he teaches them how to fight each other better
	- He coaches one to hurt the other and they start crying
	- Lark says it's the other kid's turn and tries to teach him a leg sweep
	- Both children succeed in their actions and are very hurt right now
	- Lark asks if there are more of them
	- Lark tries to pay one of the kids to start a fight club with their siblings
	- The kid explains soccer to Lark and agrees to teach him.
- Lark and the kids go out to hang out in Main St and his disks begin to tug and vibrate in proximity to the two people having a transaction
	- Lark makes a bet he can stop the time loop; if he does, the kid will buy one of Ernests' sasparillas
	- As Lark walks up and the transaction continues past the point; Lark fixed the time loop and wins the bet.
