# Synopsis

[[Harrigan-Penn Party]] observes [[Lark]]'s home progress through its time loop. They notice crude tombstones near the home marked "Mom," and three other for children also named after birds. The group gives Lark their condolences, each feeling some remorse for the shit they gave the kid during their journey up to this point. [[Fineas Penn]] attempts to use the [[Left Hand of the Foreman]] to cast [[Speak with Dead]] on the tombstones, but is only able to tell that Lark's family is caught in an in-between state of life and death in their time loop, which he remarks internally is similar to how he himself feels. The group discusses the time loop with Lark, and finds that Lark has tried to re-enter the house, but that it kicks him out at the same time each day, and that the time loop can only affect the outside world (not the other way around). Lark is revealed to have remained with his old home for at least 2 years.

Fineas observes the turquoise glints in the air and feels that they are much stronger here, while also noting that they feel different from the mycelium sensation he felt while communing with the [[Mushroom Idol]]. He brings the [[Left Hand of the Foreman]] out and draws along the arcs of the glints, feeling it twitch as it passes over. Thinking about the images the mushroom showed him, he decides to share his plan to approach [[Darton]] to reach the power within to Pony, claiming that he believes he could summon the [[Chrono Kid]] or directly resolve the time loop at Lark's home. Pony shares it with the others, and they seem to mostly agree.

While discussing the encounter prior with [[Crusaders of Eve|Eve's Cathars]], Lark and Pony remark that it was interesting how they seemed eager to use magic themselves, but condemned others for using it. Deciding to read the holy book/manifesto Lark stole off the guard [[Slim Jim]] killed, he recalls that there are two primary sects of the [[Crusaders of Eve]]: one that believes primarily in the life-oriented teachings of their god, and one that cares more about "righteousness" and believes that magic is wrong if it is "not of Eve" (i.e. if others use it for other aims that they deem heretical). He finds a passage that shows that the group [[Harrigan-Penn Party]] encountered belonged to the latter sect. Fineas then closes his eyes, and is granted the entire history of the [[Church of Eve]] in a vision, with the following notable points highlighted:
- The continent used to be inhabited by the Tokwa, who called it [[Tikana]]. They lived largely in balance with [[The Void]], which they called The Beyond. They understood that there were other entities within the Void, but that Eve was the most powerful and benevolent of them. The Tokwa retreated north throughout colonization, and today it is unknown if any of them remain, as any potential modern groups are uncontacted.
- The Tokwa built artifacts to serve as foci of the Void so that they could harness its energy in a somewhat stable manner. The Tokwa used these and a set of simple tenets respecting life and the natural order; these tools were not supposed to be used to do things that disrupt this order, i.e. for evil aims. Ruins are scattered across the continent. The item in Darton is not a focus.
- [[Bill McGraw]] caused the [[Void Calamity|Void Calamity]]

Lark looks over the edge of [[Wolf's Spine Gorge]] and barely sees a flame at the bottom. He points it out to Pony and the gang. Pony fashions a makeshift telescope out of spare items he was carrying, and with it is able to see that the fire was lit by an apparent archaeologist at the bottom of the Gorge. The gang sleeps in shifts, and come morning, decides to jump down to extract information from him. Pony casts [[Feather Falling]], shoving [[Deputy Arnold|Arnold]] down to join the rest of the group at the bottom. He lets the group fall fast for a brief moment to give Lark the sensation of flight, but this causes Arnold to vomit directly onto Pony. Upon landing, the group immediately wakes the archaeologist, who, frightened, introduces himself as [[Friedrich Heidelheim]]. Through some introductory discussion, Fineas takes interest in his apparent desire to learn how to harness [[The Void]] for productive aims, and his apparent knowledge of the [[Tokwa]]. Fineas asks Friedrich to talk later about his plan to visit [[Darton]]. Friedrich inspects Lark's discs, and is interested in how ancient they are and how similar in form they seem to be to some much larger stones he sketched.

The group eventually decides to go deeper into the gorge to find the source of all of the turquoise tendrils wrapping through the air. As they venture deeper, Lark calls Friedrich "Piss Boy" and the nickname sticks. Pony Harrigan yells "Piss Boy" into a rock to create a stone that repeats it ad-nauseum. This echoes throughout the canyon. Suddenly, a group of [[Basilisk|Basilisks]] appear and target the group. Friedrich initially hides behind a rock and observes as the rest of the party performs magical feats, dealing heavy damage in the first few volleys and managing to avoid being turned to stone. Despite these early gains and dispatching one of the basilisks, the party is less lucky in the following turns. Many attacks miss. Frierich pops up and takes a pot shot at one of them, and begins to turn to stone. Lark helps him as Slim Jim actually does turn to stone. The party eventually kills all of them not mortally wounded, but Jim remains stone. Lark puts his disks up to Jim, weakening the stone effect, and Friedrich crafts a potion of [[Lesser Restoration]] from the Basilisks' venom. Together, this pair is able to cure Slim Jim's condition, though it almost entirely expends the energy within Lark's disks for the time being.

The group decides to take a short rest within the Gorge, and is summarily ambushed by a [[Cloaker]], which they're able to put down in short notice despite it producing several illusory copies. The group continues towards the center of the Gorge. They enter a cavern near the center. Here, the threads form a single mass going deeper down a central chasm. A blue-green glow is cast throughout the cave. Lark and Pony are able to see images of events throughout time and space in each of the strands. Pony points out one of Darton as it appears in old photographs prior to its fall, and Fineas remarks that it doesn't look like that anymore. At the bottom of the drop is a tangled ball of the threads shifting and writhing. Lark takes out the shards he gathered from the [[Cactus Hydra]], and they immediately fly out into the chasm and disappear into the light. Fineas feels the Hand twitch.

Pony decides to send his hand down to scout it out and see what happens. As the hand gets deeper, it briefly and intermittently flashes and transforms into an earlier version of itself; a prototype phase, the original drawing, bare materials, etc. Hypothesizing that it will be destroyed if he sends it further, Pony discusses this conundrum with Friedrich, before sending it. A thread reaches out and touches the hand, and the hand is atomized. All the while, Lark notices that the stone surrounding the group is somehow newer than it ought to be. Slim Jim observes the thread that touched the hand and sees it darken, knot, and shoot out through a hole in the stone.
