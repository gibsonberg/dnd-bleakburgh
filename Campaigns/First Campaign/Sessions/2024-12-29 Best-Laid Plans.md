# Synopsis

A hooded figure spotted in the [[Sundance#Doctor's Office|doctor's office]] slips into the crowd outside of the office unseen. [[Fineas Penn]] and [[Lark]] decide to head towards the [[Sundance#Library|Library]] with intent for Lark to sneak in and find any texts on the [[Chrono Kid]]. [[Slim Jim]] and [[Friedrich Heidelheim|Friedrich]] agree to perform a drug deal for [[Doctor Martin]] **(Jones? the smoker, TODO: Verify with previous episode)**, but get caught up on their way out and are brought into the same office as [[Pony Harrigan|Pony]] and [[Deputy Arnold#Arnold]]. Pony and Arnold are still partaking in therapy and admit that they have feelings for one another. Pony and the rest of the gang in the room argue about whether to go the the library or to the [[Sundance#The Painted Steed|Painted Steed]].

The gang order drinks at the Painted Steed. Pony's goes down like water. The barkeep has [[Fermented Milk]] for Slim Jim, and Friedrich's whiskey acts quick. Friedrich finds himself a bar fling and sneaks off to another room. A hooded [[The Creature|wise man]] sits in a far corner begging for change in exchange for fortunes. One patron doesn't take kindly to their fortune and attempts to deal a blow to the wise man, but is deftly parried and put on his back. The wise man goes back to giving fortunes. As he gives one to a woman trying to grow petunias, Pony interjects to provide unsolicited advice.

Pony sends Arnold off and decides to ask the wise man for advice about their relationship. The wise man offers a reply almost identical to the advice he gave to the lady seeking help with her petunias. Pony pays a fake gold coin for the advice. The wise man sees the aura the party members picked up from the [[Wolf's Spine Gorge#Time Yarn|Time Yarn]]. Slim Jim assesses the wise man, and on a natural 20, comes to the conclusion that the wise man's origins were similar to his own. Slim Jim checks in with [[Slim Jim#Megan|Megan]] and learns Fineas' and Lark's destination from her. The remaining group gets the wise man's help and heads towards the library while Friedrich finishes his audible stint with another man in a closet on the floor above.

Fineas and Lark enter the library and ask [[Gladys Thornby|the librarian, Gladys Thornby]], for help finding a book on the [[Chrono Kid]]. She directs the duo to a few main sources. The first is a book titled _The Chrono Kid and Other Modern Folklore_, which describes various void anomalies and how the hopelessness that arose from the [[Void Calamity]] lead to folktales such as those about the Chrono Kid. It mentions that some insist the Chrono Kid is real, but all academic sources disagree. Lark has no further interest in this book. The second book is titled _A Brief History of Darton and Its Impacts on the Modern World_.

This text describes how a tycoon by the name of [[Bill McGraw]] performed experiments within [[Darton]] that directly caused the [[Void Calamity]]. There are reports of the temporary planar displacement of the entire city of Darton, and it is mentioned how now only a crater remains in the city's place. Nobody knows the location of McGraw's notes, but the knowledge of people working with him made its way out of Darton via word of mouth. 75 years after the Calamity, scientists used McGraw's data to perform further experiments. The tools they developed with this data were intended to control [[The Void]] in ways McGraw's attempts failed to. The overall implication of the text is that Darton's connection to reality is tenuous at best -- nobody knows what happens when somebody crosses the [[Darton#Anti-Life Zone|anti-life zone]]. People have crossed, but nobody comes back out. All tales about the zone that tell of gruesome deaths are mere hearsay; Darton is thought by academics to simply be "between places." Lark checks the authors of this book and notes that they are [[The Authors|Jonas Finnegan and Cheryl Still]]. He asks Gladys about them. Last she's heard, they headed to [[Silverton]]. Fineas peruses a 25-year old newspaper about [[Beatstone]], the most recent, but finds nothing particularly interesting.

- The wise man leads the rest of the gang to the library. Clark is with them, and gets them into the library without a card.
- I see a similar emptiness in the eyes of the wise man. I list off two of my utterances and he fills them in correctly.
	- The wise man was void touched at the Forsaken Idol - he describes as a piece of stone that reaches high far below
- The group heads towards an inn and passes a bunch of drunk partiers who are very loud and cause Lark a lot of discomfort.
- Distracting the guards: get into a fake drunk brawl with Arnold outside the library to draw the attention of the guards.
	- Not meant harshly: YOU THINK PONY WOULD EVER GO FOR A GUY LIKE YOU? Hah, you're out of your mind Arnold
	- He doesn't even like yew.
	- You ain't enough man for a guy like Pony. He likes em big.
- While we sleep, Pony gets stabbed by the hooded figure we saw and then promptly forgot. The creature detects this and busts the door down, stunning and dealing great damage. Finneas and the others wake up, and Finneas is immediately charmed by the creature's spectral pseudopod.
	- The assassin seems familiar to Fineas, maybe.
	- The figure breaks out of their stun and attempts to break out of the window, but they are barred.
	- The creature destroys the assassin. I cast speak with dead
		- Who are you? A voice I know Ive heard before. They were sent to send a message.
		- What's the message: We were not meant to meddle in their affairs
		- Member of the Crusaders of Eve? Yes
		- Why Pony? He resisted the font
		- Who am I to you? Just a petulant prisoner. The oracle that looked back down the tunnel.
- In the assassin's belongings:
	- Dagger with three-ray sun symbol on pommel
	- List of names: Pony - Kill, Finneas - Question, Jim - Test, Lark - Unimportant (he says he is to be made king)

- Cheapest houses to own in Sundance are ~250-300 gold
- I take lark to a plae that makes things out of animal parts - The Tanned Hide
- Pony considers upgrading his armor with the Chimera scales
- The creature absorbs the body
- Slim Jim takes a cat nap and has a vision. Charred, blackened fireplace. Tendrils splay about the ground. Following up the connection, it rises like roots to a body, shriveled and twisted. Several faces on one body. It speaks with both as if it's one voice: Slim Jim. Jim has found another that "stems from us". Slim Jim relays the creature's desire to free the material realm from its wealth. If it shows itself to be in opposition to JIm's cause, it is to be dispatched of. This is not elaborated on.
	- Jim asks about Finneas. He has touched the world. What he will do remains to be seen.
	- The dominant head begins to yawn, revealing cat-like canines, ending the dream.
- Someone in a zoot suit says "two rows for the cat" through the door just as the creature finishes digesting most of the body
	- Slim Jim didn't know who or where to look for.
	- The mafia member suggest Jim throw Friedrich under the bus to cover for a lost brick
	- The dude tries to jump through the barred window for his exit
- Slim Jim delivers the coke to Dr Jones. They get into a scuffle over the agreement of "two rows for the cat"
	- Jones gets a few early hits, but Slim Jim heals and hits 4 times with Smite
	- Slim Jim instakills the fucker. He is painted across the walls.
- Heist
	- Jim & Fineas on team distraction, Lark/Creature/Pony on team infiltration
	- Pony self-disguises as Gladys and acts like he's bringing Lark back to return a book he stole. The guards believe it and let them into the library.
	- Lark fails to pick the lock of the locked room (case?) within the chamber.
	- Pony fucks up his attempt to make a hole in the case, shattering a window. It goes unnoticed and the creature unlocks it.
	- Lark decides to forgo the plan now that there's damage and just steal all of the books he can. He has 4 minutes -- he clears a shelf (20 books).
- Everybody meets at the inn and we immediately have to leave. As Lark reaches the door of the Inn, he's met by an officer looking into the death of Jones.
	- I hold Slim Jim to attempt to disguise.
	- The officer seemingly sees throught it
	- Lark tries to bribe the police officer and fails. The party immediately resorts to Attack Creature from the bag
	- The creature mauls the officer, stunning him, and emanates a fart sound audible for 300 feet.
	- The officer is successfully pulled into the bag as far as his head, closing the drawstring he dies instantly.
- We flee towards the gates as more officers arrive at the inn
- The creature says from within the bag, hearing us talk about the Chrono Kid, "The presence is there"
- Slim Jim describes seeing a special artifact similar to Lark's disks north of Sundance
- The creature uses spectral arms to assist the party in climbing over Sundance's wall
	- Arnold fails to climb, but Fineas helps him at cost to speed
	- The creature takes Friedrich into his body to carry him up directly
- We are up on the wall.
- Seeing that the wall is 40 feet high, the group decides to take the fall.
	- Fineas drags his pickaxe down.
- We sprint in a random direction until Sundance is just a blip. It turns out we ran south towards the gorge.
