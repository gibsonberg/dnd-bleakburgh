# Synopsis

A hooded figure spotted in the doctor's office slips into the crowd outside of the office unseen.

- The hooded figure slips into the crowd outside of the doctor's office.
- Fineas and Lark head towards the library with intent for lark to sneak in and find any texts on the Chrono Kid.
- Slim Jim and Friedrich agree to performing a drug deal for Dr. Martin (Jones? the smoker), but on their way out get caught up and brought into the same office as Pony and Arnold
- Pony and Arnold admit feelings for one another
- Pony and the rest of the gang with him argue about going to the library before deciding to go to the painted steed
- They order drinks. Pony's goes down like water. The barkeep has fermented milk. Friedrich's whiskey acts quick
- Max's character is introduced as the hooded "wise man" in the bar, parrying a blow from an aggressive patron
- Pony interjects into one of the wise man's fortunes referring to woman trying to grow petunias, giving unsolicited growing advice
- Pony sends off Arnold and gets advice about his relationship. It is effectively the same as was given for the petunias. Pony pays a fake gold coin
- The wise man sees the aura around the party members
- Slim Jim notices the aura
	- Slim Jim passes a nat 20 on a medicine check on the wise man. His origins are similar to Slim Jim's
	- Slim Jim communicates with Megan and learns Finneas and Lark left towards the library
- With help from the wise man, the remaining group heads towards the library after Friedrich finishes his stint with the other man in the closet above
- Me and Lark enter the library and speak to a librarian (Gladys Thornby) to help us find a book on the Chrono Kid
	- The Chrono Kid and Other Modern Folklore
		- Things about void anomalies & the kind of hopelessness that arose from unprecedented circumstances giving rise to rhese sorts of folktales. Some people insist the Kid is real, but all academic sources disagree
	- A Brief History of Darton and its Impacts on the Modern World
		- A Tycoon by the name of Bill McGraw did experiments within Darton which caused the Void Calamity. There are reports of the temporary planar displacement of the entire city of Darton. There was just a crater there, and 75 years later scientists did experiments using McGraw's data. The tools developed were meant to control the void in ways McGraw's attempts failed to. The implication is that Darton's connection to reality is tenuous. Nobody knows what happens when someone crosses, but that nobody has come back out. All of the tales of gruesome deaths are hearsay -- Darton is referred to as simply between places. Nobody knows the location of McGraw's notes, but the knowledge of people working with him made its way out of Darton via other people.
		- Authors: Jonas Finnegan, Cheryl Still -> they went to Silverton last Gladys heard
	- A 25-year old newspaper about Beatstone is the most recent. Nothing particularly useful.
- The wise man leads the rest of the gang to the library. Clark is with them, and gets them into the library without a card.
- I see a similar emptiness in the eyes of the wise man. I list off two of my utterances and he fills them in correctly.
	- The wise man was void touched at the Forsaken Idol - he describes as a piece of stone that reaches high far below
- The group heads towards an inn and passes a bunch of drunk partiers who are very loud and cause Lark a lot of discomfort.
- Distracting the guards: get into a fake drunk brawl with Arnold outside the library to draw the attention of the guards.
	- Not meant harshly: YOU THINK PONY WOULD EVER GO FOR A GUY LIKE YOU? Hah, you're out of your mind Arnold
	- He doesn't even like yew.
	- You ain't enough man for a guy like Pony. He likes em big.
- While we sleep, Pony gets stabbed by the hooded figure we saw and then promptly forgot. The creature detects this and busts the door down, stunning and dealing great damage. Finneas and the others wake up, and Finneas is immediately charmed by the creature's spectral pseudopod.
	- The assassin seems familiar to Fineas, maybe.
	- The figure breaks out of their stun and attempts to break out of the window, but they are barred.
	- The creature destroys the assassin. I cast speak with dead
		- Who are you? A voice I know Ive heard before. They were sent to send a message.
		- What's the message: We were not meant to meddle in their affairs
		- Member of the Crusaders of Eve? Yes
		- Why Pony? He resisted the font
		- Who am I to you? Just a petulant prisoner. The oracle that looked back down the tunnel.
- In the assassin's belongings:
	- Dagger with three-ray sun symbol on pommel
	- List of names: Pony - Kill, Finneas - Question, Jim - Test, Lark - Unimportant (he says he is to be made king)
- Slim Jim reveals that sometimes while sleeping, he can see his owners.
	- They look different - more shapely
	- They always praise Slim
- We decide on a new heist plan
- Cheapest houses to own in Sundance are ~250-300 gold
- I take lark to a plae that makes things out of animal parts - The Tanned Hide
- Pony considers upgrading his armor with the Chimera scales
- The creature absorbs the body
- Slim Jim takes a cat nap and has a vision. Charred, blackened fireplace. Tendrils splay about the ground. Following up the connection, it rises like roots to a body, shriveled and twisted. Several faces on one body. It speaks with both as if it's one voice: Slim Jim. Jim has found another that "stems from us". Slim Jim relays the creature's desire to free the material realm from its wealth. If it shows itself to be in opposition to JIm's cause, it is to be dispatched of. This is not elaborated on.
	- Jim asks about Finneas. He has touched the world. What he will do remains to be seen.
	- The dominant head begins to yawn, revealing cat-like canines, ending the dream.
- Someone in a zoot suit says "two rows for the cat" through the door just as the creature finishes digesting most of the body
	- Slim Jim didn't know who or where to look for.
	- The mafia member suggest Jim throw Friedrich under the bus to cover for a lost brick
	- The dude tries to jump through the barred window for his exit
- Slim Jim delivers the coke to Dr Jones. They get into a scuffle over the agreement of "two rows for the cat"
	- Jones gets a few early hits, but Slim Jim heals and hits 4 times with Smite
	- Slim Jim instakills the fucker. He is painted across the walls.
- Heist
	- Jim & Fineas on team distraction, Lark/Creature/Pony on team infiltration
	- Pony self-disguises as Gladys and acts like he's bringing Lark back to return a book he stole. The guards believe it and let them into the library.
	- Lark fails to pick the lock of the locked room (case?) within the chamber.
	- Pony fucks up his attempt to make a hole in the case, shattering a window. It goes unnoticed and the creature unlocks it.
	- Lark decides to forgo the plan now that there's damage and just steal all of the books he can. He has 4 minutes -- he clears a shelf (20 books).
- Everybody meets at the inn and we immediately have to leave. As Lark reaches the door of the Inn, he's met by an officer looking into the death of Jones.
	- I hold Slim Jim to attempt to disguise.
	- The officer seemingly sees throught it
	- Lark tries to bribe the police officer and fails. The party immediately resorts to Attack Creature from the bag
	- The creature mauls the officer, stunning him, and emanates a fart sound audible for 300 feet.
	- The officer is successfully pulled into the bag as far as his head, closing the drawstring he dies instantly.
- We flee towards the gates as more officers arrive at the inn
- The creature says from within the bag, hearing us talk about the Chrono Kid, "The presence is there"
- Slim Jim describes seeing a special artifact similar to Lark's disks north of Sundance
- The creature uses spectral arms to assist the party in climbing over Sundance's wall
	- Arnold fails to climb, but Fineas helps him at cost to speed
	- The creature takes Friedrich into his body to carry him up directly
- We are up on the wall.
- Seeing that the wall is 40 feet high, the group decides to take the fall.
	- Fineas drags his pickaxe down.
- We sprint in a random direction until Sundance is just a blip. It turns out we ran south towards the gorge.
