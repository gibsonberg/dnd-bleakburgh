# Synopsis

[[Harrigan-Penn Party|The group]] races south of [[Sundance]] until they practically collapse from exhaustion about 8 miles from the city, immediately falling into a long rest. They manage to keep watch. [[Lark]] watches first, to no major event. Lark wakes [[Fineas Penn|Fineas]], who notices that the glow surrounding the members of the party from their earlier exposure to the [[Wolf's Spine Gorge#Time Yarn|Time Yarn]] has faded slightly. Fineas wakes [[Friedrich Heidelheim|Friedrich]], who tries to flee. The group wakes up to commotion and confronts him about it, threatening him and agreeing that they need to grab his notes on the Tokwa if he is to flee. [[Pony Harrigan|Pony]] takes over Friedrich's watch and notices a cloud of dust on the horizon. He wakes [[Deputy Arnold|Arnold]], who can clearly see that it's law enforcement. The party is awoken and set to prepare for conflict.

As everybody sets up to keep moving towards [[Wolf's Spine Gorge]], Pony and Lark agree to have a race. Lark beats Pony handily and just keeps going as the party begins to move. He's barely slower than a horse. While they move, Fineas offers an alternative plan: head to [[Silverton]]. After some discussion, they decide to keep going back to [[Wolf's Spine Gorge#Lark's House|Lark's House]] to set up an ambush. The party agrees to strip Friedrich of his weapons to ensure he doesn't betray them.

The party arrives at Lark's house. Knowing that the house will erupt in flames just in time to provide a distraction, Pony disguises himself as a young girl perfectly and the rest of the group hides behind rocks and berms in the vicinity. Sundance law enforcement arrives at the scene and believe it fully; Pony is somehow perfectly playing the part of a distressed child begging for help as her home burns down. The guards approach

- They go to Lark's house. Pony disguises as a child on a nat 20, and the rest of the group hides around the vicinity
	- The ambush strikes, and only Lark really has luck with hitting at first. Pony decides to self-immolate, warning the team that he's going to hit a Cactus Forest. The team flees except for Arnold, whom Fineas protects. Half the pursuers are dead, and the team strikes again.
	- They win the encounter, killing the entire party of officers with few hit points remaining
- Fineas takes a rifle as a trophy
- Lark speaks intimidatingly with Friedrich, showing him a severed head, but eventually showing a little restraint. This gets him to spill what he read on Darton
	- They write about people not having returned, but it's expressely remarked that nobody has been reported dead, only missing. The zone could go *anywhere*, it could take you somewhere else or kill you.
	- Bill McGraw was a railroad tycoon 150 years ago. His experiments with the knowledge that he took from the Tokwa revealed its proximity to the void. It may be more like a pocket dimension based on other anomalies and minor events.
	- It is proposed that this is just the rest of Bleakburgh turned up.
- Friedrich shows the party his map of the world, and reveals that air travel exists. Lark is very enthused with the idea until he learns its via machines.
- Looking at the local updated maps, we see that to the Northwest of Sundance there are Tokwa ruins north in the direction Slim Jim described feeling a tug.
	- We decide to take horses to the ruins, and then go to Sundance
- We long rest. Slim Jim notices Lark's aura moves, and as he makes the movements, there are blue afterimages that trace out every possible iteration of that motion.
	- Slim Jim tells us all in the morning.
- After discussing the horse breakdown (I got put on Clyve), we ride off.
- Arriving at the ruins, we see "naturally shaped" rock pillars standing in an array.
	- Approaching, them, I see that there are faded symbols worn away by weather on them. There are faces carved in some of them. They look like they depict some sort of story. Getting closer, there's a lip of stone jutting upwards that's incongruous from the rest of the surrounding sand. It doesn't look like tools were used.
	- There's a staircase under the lip that leads into some sort of cavern. It stone is gently sloping. I see, in the contours of the rock, the faintest outline of something that looks almost organic. There are two divets narrowing like eyes. Once this thing sees we have approached, massive should blades in the stone near and curling paws pull up over the stone.
