Campaign: [[First Campaign]]
Setting: [[Bleakburgh]]

Previous Session: [[2024-12-01 Regression]]
Next Session: [[2024-12-29 Best-Laid Plans]]

The party begins having just watched Pony's hand crawl into the pit and touch the "[[Wolf's Spine Gorge#Time Yarn|time yarn]]" in [[Wolf's Spine Gorge]], being atomized in the process and causing a thread to shoot off into the distance. As [[Harrigan-Penn Party]] stands around the pit, Fineas feels as though something similar to what happened to Pony's hand is happening to the rest of us on a slower scale. The group as a whole notices certain recent memories (such as what [[Friedrich Heidelheim]] means to the group) have begun to disappear. They decide to leave, running towards the opening of the cavern. As the group runs, [[Pony Harrigan]] and [[Fineas Penn]] reminisce on one of [[Freddy Faazbare]]'s hit songs, singing "AR AR AR AR AR".

The group eventually leaves the cave and decides to rest for the night. Friedrich and Pony get into an argument over calling one another gay. Pony yells that he and [[Deputy Arnold|Arnold]] never had sex, and it rings out across the canyons. Embarrassed, Pony gets extremely drunk during his downtime to help ease both his emotional pain and the pain of supplying a pint of blood to the crafting of a new homunculus-hand. At the end of his watch, he wakes Arnold and falls asleep in his cot. Arnold decides to sleep in Pony's cot after his shift, and wakes [[Slim Jim]]. Slim Jim's watch passes uneventfully, discussing a few things with [[Slim Jim#Megan|Megan]]. He wakes Fineas. Fineas spends his watch bugging Megan with a question on idioms despite not being able to understand her. Afterwards, he sits and stares at Friedrich for a while before waking him to ask him about [[Darton]]. He is extremely upset at this, and Fineas eventually lets him get back to sleep. As Fineas' watch ends, he notices that the members of the party have a faint turquoise aura about them.

[[Lark]], upset that the party did not wake him for watch, lashes out by putting Friedrich's hand in a cup of warm water to cause him to pee himself. As everyone wakes, Friedrich notices his freshly-peed pants and crashes out on Lark. At the same time, Pony proclaims that he did not pee himself. Throughout the day, Fineas specifically averts his gaze from Friedrich to try to give him space until he deemed it a good time to talk about Darton. Friedrich is seemingly shell-shocked for most of the day, but gets one moment of joy in as he launches his peed pants into Pony's Bag of Holding, causing a few other items within to be coated in urine.

The group begins to leave the Gorge and are attacked by a group of three [[Large Scorpions]]. The first two are quickly dispatched without causing significant harm to any of the party, and the third begins to flee. It, too, is dealt with shortly. Just as the party begins to celebrate, a [[Chimera]] takes the opportunity to attack from above. Seeing Lark as the smallest and weakest, it targets him first. Pony deals a great deal of damage to it, drawing its ire and falling immediately to a breath attack upon its landing. The rest of the party moves to flank. Eventually, Pony is raised back to his feet. The Chimera is finally dealt the killing blow by Lark, earning him 20 points in the game of "Cows" being played by the party.

The party finally arrives in [[Sundance]]. It is clearly substantially better built and maintained than the other settlements  the party has so far encountered over the course the campaign. Music resonates from within and drunk townspeople cause a ruckus on top of the walls. The gate is guarded by two the the most heavily-armed people the party has yet seen, wielding rifles with bayonets and wearing force-dissipating armor. After some discussion and Pony and Fineas presenting their ID documents, the rest of the party is conditionally allowed in. The Party immediately heads towards a doctor for hygiene and to get Lark some mental assistance after all that he has been through.

At the front desk of the doctor's office, Lark is extremely shy around so many people. Fineas takes on a parental role and checks everyone in. There is a brief moment where Lark raises his weapons, disturbing the peace in the waiting room, but Fineas convinces him that it's okay to turn them into the clinic staff temporarily. The party is split into three separate groups: Fineas and Lark; Slim Jim, Mary/Shelley, and Friedrich; and Pony and Arnold. Fineas and Lark are served by an extremely professional and outwardly-normal "talkyfeelytrist" [[Doctor Brenner]] who not only gives Lark a bath, but talks him through some of his issues with support from Fineas. Slim Jim is observed by a veterinarian-cum-doctor to study his odd bipedal feline form while the other two members of that group waited and watched. The vet smokes and is crude as he examines Slim Jim's body and past, and dismissed Friedrich's request for a mental health professional. Finally, Pony and Arnold are effectively given relationship counseling by an annoying, brand-new doctor. Pony is also questioned about his drinking habits.
