Previous Session: [[2025-02-03 Meeting Resistance]]
Next Session: [[2025-03-24 Goodbyes]]

- Lark comes running back into Pony's arms sobbing hysterically about losing Slim Jim to the Cathars
- This clearly ruins the original stealth plan Ainsley was working on to raid an ammo depot -- they have to attack as soon as they can muster forces.
- The Chrono Kid goes to update the Authors; he brings Fern down into the tunnels as well
- We have to go to the mines. The tunnel has been closed for some time; Fineas and gang are to help unseal it
- We cut scene to a cell in the mines.
	- Jim is unconscious, disarmed, and without armor. Hands are bound in chain, hands locked in place. preventing spells that require hand movements. 1 HP & two levels of exhaustion.
	- There are many emaciated people within other, similar cells within this corridor.
	- Conditions are terrible. Damp and unclean.
	- After some thought, Slim Jim easily breaks the chain on his cuffs. His hands are free, but the fingers still cannot move. He's unable to break the actual gauntlets.
	- Someone across the way notices Jim break.
		- The man is gangly, angular, and crazed. His beard is years-unkempt
		- "Can you get these off?"
			- Maybe
			- You're from the other side.
			- I'm like you.
		- "What kind of god are you?"
			- Noooooooo not a god
	- There's another, more feminine person, scrawling things on the wall.
		- She hears Jim's voice but isn't looking at Jim. She's clearly blind.
		- "Are you the Cardinal? Have you brought the scalpel?" she says
		- "What are you in for?"
			- They said I could see too much. They fixed it.
	- The gangly man catches his rat and butchers it with a rock.
	- Jim gets the sense that experimental surgeries are being performed here, testing people with magical properties and so on.
	- The gangly man's name is Sebastian Carlisle.
		- "She said a god in the shape of a rat was gonna come here. she was one level off."
	- He tries to pick Jim's cuffs with rat bones. They snap in the cuffs.
	- The woman (Yvette) says they're sending a surgeon. She curls up and puts her hands over her ears.
	- Someone with a doctor's mask comes into the chamber.
		- "I am delighted to get a new patient. What's your name?"
			- > Mickey. Mouse.
				- "You're clearly a cat. Well, I guess we'll figure out how close to a mouse you are when we get on inside there"
		- He notices Jim broke his chain. He calls in Wilson, a huge, muscle-bound man. He orders Wilson to hold Jim for the surgery.
			- Jim tries to resist. Wilson underestimates Jim's strength and only uses one hand.
			- Jim overcomes him and punches him in the balls. He flees.
				- The doctor tries to grab Jim. He tries to lock himself to Jim via handcuffs.
				- He fails.
			- Jim grabs Sebastian and sprints down the hall.
- We cut back to the raiding party
	- They're discussing destroying the barrier into the mines.
	- Fineas says he could knock through the wall but it would take a few minutes. If someone's on the other side, they'd certainly be ready. They discuss shock and awe options.
	- We end up deciding on the dynamite. Fineas finds a spot that he's mostly sure will have minimal damage.
		- Pony says he can light the dynamite from afar. We all get behind a large boulder near a bend in the tunnel.
		- Pony hits the stick of dynamite with Firebolt.
		- The tunnel shakes for a moment. Debris goes everywhere. Then everything is quiet.
	- There's 10 feet of rock left. That's too much for Fineas to mine through, but Fern can teleport 5 people.
		- Arnold calls Pony his boyfriend while explaining to the Kid why he's staying back to watch.
		- On the other side, there are guards. They immediately start swinging.
		- Pony immediately cripples one of them. Another tries to run. Lark tries to chase after, but fails to hit. Fineas chases and grapples him.
		- Pony fails trying the green flame balde trick again, harming himself.
		- The one who tried to flee breaks the grapple, but is killed by Lark's blade.
		- Lark shoots the one currently engaged with Pony, killing him instantly.
		- Only the crippled one remains. Pony kicks him in the head, ending him.
	- Everyone is on the other side.
		- Pony grabs two sets of armor for his projects.
- We cut back to Slim Jim
	- Jim is sprinting through the caverns, not sure where he's headed.
	- Sebastian is frantically guiding Jim through.
	- Coming to a fork in the road, Jim sees people down one path and chooses the other.
	- "Oh Kitty CAt! We're coming to get you!"
	- Jim comes upon 3 guards, surprising them.
		- He smites one of them with the gauntlets, killing them instantly.
		- Sebastian leaps on another guard and bites the dude's throat out.
			- This instantly intimidates the remaining guard. He takes off.
	- Jim and Sebastian are sprinting after him. It is presumed he's running toward the exit.
	- This guy kicks Sebastian the the jaw and then runs off towards growing voices. Jim takes a different path.
	- Sebastian tells Jim to wait and to go down a particular cavern to get something.
		- Sebastian unlocks it with his pinky nail.
		- There is a room full of weapons similar to what the people on the zeppelin had, but hooked up to various decomposing bodies.
		- Sebastian and Jim rip the weapons from the bodies. They hum with familiar energy.
		- Jim is unable to be freed from the cups so he can't use the gun as intended. He has to bonk enemies with it.
- Cut back to main group, intermittently swapping to Jim
	- They discuss opening cells to release people as a distraction. They decide Lark may if there's anyone who looks like they might actually be able to do something.
	- We find one who's enthusiastically wanting to kill the Cathars and going crazy. Lark frees him and gives him the two Cathars daggers to go kill them, as long as he doesn't kill Jim
	- We continue running down the hallway.
		- Fern feels that there's a massive forge somewhere within the mines due to her connection to hearths.
	- Jim finally hears Lark calling his name in the distance.
	- Jim calls back and Lark hears him. He bolts off towards Jim.
		- Jim's call alerts 3 of the guards not killed by the angry man.
			- Sebastian mows them down with his gun.
	- Jim encounters the crazed man and is granted safe passage as he continues to stab guards.
- Slim Jim is reunited with the group.
	- Lark unlocks Jim's hands.
	- The doctor comes in with Wilson and sees the whole group. Jim and Sebastian level their weapons.
		- The energy from the weapon is very different from the mushroom -- it is not of the material world
		- The pair fires at the two Cathars.
			- They hit. The bullets cause energy that burns away the skin and muscle -- it appears to simply cease to exist, not as of this world as with the various Beatstone effects.
		- We enter combat
			- I immediately sprint up, raging, to Wilson, seeing him as the greater threat between the two.
			- The doctor tries to jab me with a syringe, missing.
			- Pony heals Jim a little and puts himself between the Doctor and Jim
			- Arnold shoots the doctor(?) once.
			- Wilson literally grabs Fineas by my head and throws me 40 ft.
			- Chrono Kid casts shatter using sideways finger guns on the Cathar pair. The doctor is really not looking good.
			- Jim attacks the doctor; he uses reaction to touch something on his wrist to absorb the damage.
			- Lark sees Wilson's chest open up to his beating heart. He shoots the man right there, killing him instantly.
			- Fern commands the little goober (a ferret) to fucking obliterate the doctor. He is like, imploded.
- Body search
	- Lark searches the doctor's body for the shield thing. It is broken.
	- Fineas looks at Wilson; he's just built like that
	- Pony finds a belt of the doctor's syringes
- Fern has shared that there's this engine below the space.
- The crazed man comes back, clearly more calm from his rampage. He's convinced to come with the party.
	- Him and Lark release 30 people across 10 cells.
	- As Lark does this, he proclaims himself the true prophet and the Son of Eve.
		- He rolls a nat 20. They are truly convinced.
		- "These are my wise men... and Fern"
		- Lark rallies the prisoners to free their fellow prisoners and kill the Cathars
- Sebastian brings the prisoners to the room with the weaponry. We can hear it throughout the tunnels.
- The crazed man's name is Giuseppi de Luca.
- We enter an elevator which noisily takes us down a shaft.
	- At the bottom, the door opens to an expansive cavern.
	- At the end is a large body (like, a Giant) hooked up to a bunch of wires.
		- It's made of body parts that were human.
		- At the back of it is a giant hearth. Within it is a turquoise flame.
	- There is a hooded figure at the end of a table holding hands over the body.
		- It's Maisie Penn.
	- Fineas walks closer. Her pupils are not there. she's in some sort of trance, speaking over the body.
	- There are other people working the hearth, putting stuff into it.
		- Fineas, Pony, and Jim recognize that they are loading bodies from Beatstone into the furnace.
			- I recognize neighbors.
	- I try to shake Maisie out of it. I fail at first.
		- Lark uses the portent roll to undo that. I push her backwards, breaking her resolve.
		- The Chrono Kid is shocked by Lark being able to do this.
			- The group questions why he is surprised. He persuades them into focusing on Maisie.
		- I confront Maisie. As I do, a lever is thrown in the background.
			- The body is charged and begins to twitch. One of its hands is the size of Lark. It gets up as ports disconnect. Something has gone wrong because Maisie has not finished her prayer.
			- It towers over any of us. It reels back to punch towards us.
- Combat begins
	- Pony escapes the fist and creates a mirror image of himself.
	- It crushes one of the archers as several people escape. Another is left crippled.
	- Some glancing blows from afar hit the creature.
	- The crippled crossbowman detonates an explosive under the foot of the giant.
	- Arnold commands Pony to attack the thing, but Pony misses.
	- Ainsley pulls out a grapple hook and latches onto the beast and attacks it.
	- The Chrono Kid does his stupid finger gun thing.
	- Pony casts Fairy Fire against the giant, granting advantage to everyone as it glows. Ainsley is also caught in this.
	- Lark pops out of hiding and shoots the giant, rolling a critical
		- He runs and hides behind me.
	- I fail to hit it with javelins, and run towards it
	- The creature launches a bolt of lightning from its hand to Lark & Jim. Lark takes none.
		- Jim gets knocked
	- The creature moves, causing Ainsley to fall off.
	- One of the crossbowmen shoots the beast and hits
	- Arnold shoots at the beast & misses every shot.
	- Ainsley moves away & shoots the beast twice, hitting some. She goads the beast. but doesnt succeed?
	- The Kid runs a bit and insults the giant britishly
		- It doesnt work
	- Pony shoots at the beast twice, hitting a crit once. The creature's ear hangs off. Pony moves away slightly 
	- Lark shoots the beast, hitting a crit. The thing is looking real rough
	- I hit with my pickaxe using my final rage, siccing the guardians against it.
	- It lumbers towards Lark
		- It attacks Lark, and I use my spirit shield to try to protect him.
	- Maisie finally chooses to act: she heals the Giant for 14 hp and moves towards Fineas
		- The Chrono Kid misses on an opprtunity attack as she passes.
		- She holds her talismen of eve, surrounding herself in a protective light.
	- Jim casts a spell to command the giant and Maisie to fall.
		- It falls to one knee. Maisie also fails, falling to the ground.
		- Jim uses Channel Divinity to try to heal himself a tiny amount.
	- Fern continues to move the Moon Beam. 
		- She sends the Goober over to the giant to blight the giant. It fails the check.
		- It kills the giant.
			- The Goober bounces on over. Goober crawls up to the giant and sits on his chest before casting blight. It cascades across it, draining its life force into Goober. Goober prances around.
- Maisie gets up and starts to run over to the giant.
	- I grapple her and Lark pricks her with paralyzing poison from the dagger.
	- Ainsley starts pulling out plastic explosive. We should blow up the forge beforehand?
	- Lark ties Maisie up
	- Pony analyzes the furnace.
		- He can tell that it was discovered, not built by Eve's Cathars.
			- It looks at least 300 years old. It uses rudimentary technology from an age before Darton had disappeared for the first time. McGraw, the titan of industry, used Tokwa sigil weaving with his vast resources to make these sorts of horrific machines.
			- Bill McGraw's Void Forge
			- He used this to build the machines to take over Darton.
			- The Cathars found this and used it with what they found in Beatstone to try to do whatever they could -- like now, trying to animate other beings.
			- Silverton is the HQ if Eve's Cathar's, not because of metals, but because of this forge.
		- Pony relays all of this information
- We short rest.
	- Ainsley pops her grapple hook to place the plastic explosives in the forge, says a prayer over her fallen comrades, and then we are to get out of the cavern.
- In the elevator, Lark tries to interrogate her but her jaw is clenched in shock. She has tuned everything out.
- As the elevator reaches the top, she says she'd like to talk to Fineas alone.
- Pony offers his hand to press the button on the detonator.
	- "The gun doesn't fucking work anymore!"
	- Giuseppi found a "pretty heavy thing we've been hitting people with"
		- It's actually Jim's maul
		- He's wearing Jim's armor (it looks cropped) -- he gives it back
	- Giuseppi talks about how Sebastian claims he "came from a dynasty of killers"
- Pony and Jim help Lark set up message rocks in a way that looks like it's his blessing. He adds a message saying to take refuge in the sewers and that they will launch an assault against the Cardinal.
	- Lark "blesses" Giuseppi with Jim's aid. He tells him to find "his children"
