# Synopsis

[[Harrigan-Penn Party]] exits the cave containing the [[Mushroom Idol]] in [[Beatstone]], the tunnels collapsing behind them. As they emerge, the group is met by a party of [[Crusaders of Eve|Eve's Cathars]] wearing all-white and gas masks. One of them says [[Fineas Penn|Fineas']] name, but when questioned by another if they recognize him, they slink back and deny it. The group is put in manacles, stripped of any immediately-recognizable weapons, and lead to one of the towers on the west side of the town, which is surrounded by tents.

[[Harrigan-Penn Party]] is brought into the main tent, and the interior is very ornate. Chandeliers are somehow hung within it. The group is brought in front of [[The Cardinal]] and compelled to kneel. Fineas notices [[Right Chaplain|the chaplain]] to his right is fiddling with their thumbs and looking at him -- clearly, they know Fineas. [[Lark]] spills the beans on the existence of the [[Cow Creature]] in [[Greenfang]], and he and [[Slim Jim]] are led off to another tower to be imprisoned for the time being. [[Pony Harrigan]] and Fineas remain in the tent, and are told that they might be given forgiveness if they give up their former lives for the [[Crusaders of Eve]]. Fineas reveals that the [[Mushroom Idol]] could compel his mind to some extent. After much deliberation, they accept, expecting to be stripped of their possessions in that very moment, but instead are first brought towards a second tent.

We cut to Lark and Slim Jim in their tower-prison. Lark spends a great deal of time taunting the guard. As the guard ignores him and goes to lock the pair in the tower, Lark successfully gets him with a "stupid person says nothing", telling the other guard to lock him in with the kid and storming in to strike Lark. Instead, Lark distracts him slightly. Slim Jim suddenly body slams the guard, splintering the wooden walls of the tower behind him and buckling the guard's chestplate. Blood pours out of his mouth and nostrils. Slim Jim does the same thing to the splintered pillar, toppling the entire structure as the other guard runs away. Lark and Slim Jim concoct a plan to wear the guard's armor together like two kids in a trench coat and sneak past the guards. They unconvincingly slip Jim into the grieves and Lark into the top, carrying the sword; after some deliberation, they switch positions with Slim Jim wearing the mask to avoid his face causing them to be detected. As they leave the crumbled tower, they notice Pony and Fineas being brought into the processing tent, and opt to run towards the tower where the group's weapons were being stored. They make it only partway before they see the tent explode.

Winding back, we shift focus to Fineas and Pony in the processing tent. Within the tent, there is a stone basin filled with water. Pony is brought forwards first, and is touches by [[The Cardinal]]'s thumb in the middle of his forehead. This burns pony. Fineas focuses on the Cardinal's thumbprint, and sees a flash of tendrils coming out of it, followed by visions of the font making those who are resistant complacent. "Now that the door has been built, purity can enter," says the Cardinal, having the chaplains attempt to force Pony head-first into the font. Before Pony is dipped in, he casts Thunderwave, forcing everyone away from him, toppling the tent, and spilling the font onto people, causing them to seize.

Everyone is covered in the tent's fabric. People make it out one at a time. Pony easily makes it out, as does a pair of guards. One cuts their way through the tent. Fineas uses a charge of the [[Left Hand of the Foreman]], gaining temporary HP, and crawls out of the tent right between two guards. He feels a body shrivel slightly more within the cave. Slim Jim and Lark sprint towards the action, as Pony sprints towards them. Pony magic missiles the three guards. As they near one another, Jim cures Pony of the [[Beatstone Plague]]. Fineas sprints towards them, but the guards perform a pincer maneuver. Fineas jukes out the two guards and is able to successfully outrun them with the rest of the gang. As they continue running towards their weapons, Lark sets fire to as many of the fabric tents as possible. In one instance, he's able to light two at once.

[[The Cardinal]] calls out to the Cathars. Their horses spiral the group of Crusaders, and the Cardinal slowly mounts his steed. The party reaches the tower with the Cathars on horseback not far behind. They grab their weapons, and, not wanting to be caught out front, Slim Jim smashes a Slim Jim-shaped hole in the back of the tower, allowing the gang to run straight through. This doesn't delay the Cathars long, and soon Fineas feels a tug that locks him in place as the Cardinal raises a hand. Lark shoots the Cardinal's horse, toppling it but failing to break concentration. Pony casts Magic Missile, still failing to break the Cardinal's concentration on holding Fineas. Failing to break the hold, Pony and Slim Jim opt to carry Fineas and run away as the Cardinal is now on foot. He tries to compel Lark in a similar manner and fails. The rest of the army turns away, but the Cardinal remains. He shouts and lightning crackles in a field around him. A purple shockwave launches the top of the tower. The part of the tower with the Slim-Jim shaped hole falls perfectly over Slim Jim sparing him. One of the supporting beams impales Pony and pins him to the ground. Fineas is no longer held in place, and he and Slim Jim jump into action trying to get Pony off the pole. Slim Jim slams him up the pole, doing as much damage as the initial impalement did. He then heals Pony, though a small hole straight through him remains for the time being. Fineas tries to give Pony the hand, but he is not attuned to it, so it doesn't help him at all.

The group, noticing that the army had fled, decides to head towards [[Wolf's Spine Gorge]]. Jim falls within 25 minutes of walking, and the party decides to long rest. Over the horizon, they see the [[Greenfang Patrol]] meet the [[Crusaders of Eve]]. The group sleeps in shifts, failing to notice a battered [[Deputy Arnold]] sneak into their encampment. The group ties him up, but it's eventually readily apparent that he's not a threat. The group takes Arnold along, mounting Slim Jim's spectral steed [[Slim Jim#Megan|Megan]]. Throughout the trip, Lark tells Arnold the entirety of the group's story up to that point. The group eventually settles again for a long rest. During lark's shift, he further torments Arnold by making him count his jumps (attempting to fly like birds do). Pony lets Arnold rest during his shift, but Fineas immediately decides to wake him up again, exclaiming that penguins have knees and asking Arnold about schooling for Lark. Slim Jim has an existential crisis with Megan during his shift.

As everyone wakes, they notice turquoise shimmers originating from the Gorge. Lark leads the party further along the edge until they reach his house. On Lark's correct estimation of the time, it bursts into flames and people scream within. "Hi Mom," Lark exclaims.
