Setting: [[Greenfang]], Desert

Previous Session: [[2024-10-05 Two Rows]]
Next Session: [[2024-11-09 Connections]]

The party begins in [[Greenfang]]. James and Rufus were sat at the [[Greenfang#The Tavern|Tavern]] bar. [[Deputy Arnold]] offers to take [[Pony Harrigan]] into the [[Greenfang#Underground Tunnels|underground tunnels]] where the milk is cooled, as Pony showed interest in the mechanism of cooling. The rest of the Party stays behind in the Tavern. As Arnold and Pony leave, Lark calls out something about the [[Cow Creature]] that Pony brushes off as one of the kid's conspiracy theories, and Arnold seemingly accepts this.

There's awkwardness and mild tension between Pony and Arnold as they enter the tunnels, both narrowly dodging revealing anything about the nature of their relationship and what they know about one another. In the tunnels, Arnold brings Pony to the cooled chamber and explains that it was there before they dug the chamber. As they're chatting awkwardly, Arnold pulls a gun on Pony and shoots him in the stomach, revealing that he knew that [[Harrigan-Penn Party]] knew about the [[Cow Creature]] the whole time. Pony kisses Arnold before shooting him back, also in the stomach. A chase ensues, where they're neck-and-neck. Shots are fired and daggers slash, largely missing or doing minor damage. Pony snares Arnold and steals his weaponry before booking it, though Arnold escapes the snare and quickly catches up. They attempt to grapple one another and fail, though Arnold steals his gun back. A stand off ensues, weapons pointed at one another. Pony suddenly shoots the ceiling of the tunnels, and they begin to collapse, first over Arnold and later throughout the entire system. Pony tells Arnold he's sorry and flees out towards the tavern.

While this is happening, in the tavern, Lark is egging on the remaining [[Greenfang Patrol|patrol]] members, trying to get them to admit that the [[Cow Creature]] exists so that they can ask about it without arousing suspicion. [[Slim Jim]] and [[Lark#Mary and Shelly|Mary and Shelley]] leave to discuss the factory outside. He hits James with "personwhohasagiantmutantcowsayswhat", to which James obviously responds with "what," not having made out what Lark said. Rufus, on the other hand, heard it loud and clear. He raises his shotgun at Lark and fires, hitting him. Slim Jim and Mary and Shelley enter, and begin rushing towards the bar. He attempts to fire again, but his shotgun explodes in his face. Taking this opportunity, [[Fineas Penn]] rages and rushes up to Rufus, grappling him. He beats him, Rufus' skin decaying where Fineas' punches land. Lark shoots Rufus while he's down, and Slim Jim attempts to slam Rufus with his mace, destroying nothing but the wood floor in the process. James sprints for the door, and Lark chases after. Fineas rips Rufus' head entirely off with seeming ease as the tissue around his neck is in active decay. James is terrified but continues sprinting towards the door until Slim Jim casts a spell, holding him in place. Fineas chucks a hammer at his head and misses. Lark and Slim Jim are eventually able to convince James to stick around and answer some questions via intimidation.

Lark immediately takes to torturing James, starting by singing a showtune and carving lines into his face with a dagger. The party asks questions mostly centered around the [[Greenfang#Industrial Building|factory]] and how they might go about killing [[Cow Creature|Betsy]]. All the while, Lark is teasing James with the knife, maiming his hand, and threatening to do worse. The group is largely split on whether to pursue the factory issue at the moment, leaning on just leaving due to the recent events and difficulty of taking on an entire factory's worth of people. Through this, they also learn of the [[Crusaders of Eve]]. A rumble is felt through the ground, and Pony stumbles into the tavern bleeding from his stomach. Pony seals the deal on leaving Greenfang immediately, and the party discusses what to do with James. They consider trying to get him to kill the cow for them, but it's immediately clear he's lying when he agrees. They instead decide to cut off his tongue and heal him so it doesn't kill him, stranding him in the tavern. Pony is healed, and the group sets off in a rush, leaving the milk they had traded for behind. As they leave, they see a line of crumbled earth leading towards the factory, and a shadowed, limping figure entering it. It's clear this is Arnold.

The group sets off to the west, towards [[Beatstone]], the nearest settlement. To do so, the party has to traverse a desert for about three and a half days. They discuss sending the [[Crusaders of Eve]] to destroy the town, though ultimately are unsure as much of the party are anomalous themselves. As night settles on the first day of them pushing onwards, they notice torches following them at a distance, which eventually go out for the night. Knowing they are being followed, the group decides to push on moving through the night, taking exhaustion. The next day is oppressively hot, and the group is desperate for shade. They decide to follow a dry stream bed littered with footprints, hoping that it would obscure their path and bring them to some shelter. The come across a natural divet with holes carve in the side, clearly of animal origin. Pony approaches one, and learns that the holes are inhabited by [[Large Desert Snakes|large desert snakes]]; the snakes are clearly on eye level while curled up. As the group backs up, it's clear that there's an entire den of them beneath their feet, and moving too fast would result in the collapse of the sandy surface on which they are standing. They successfully escape the patch of sand above the den, but Pony feels it's necessary to create some sort of ruse to trick anyone still following them that they died in the [[The Desert#Snake Pit|snake pit]]. He crafts a rock that smells like a fresh kill, and places it in the pit, causing a frenzy. They continue walking until nightfall, deciding it's now safe enough to camp in a shallow valley.

Pony takes first watch. Still exhausted, he spends a lot of time crafting [[Snake Rock|snake rocks]], rocks that make snake noises, and places them on the outskirts of the camp, hoping to scare anyone approaching them away from the camp. He notices nothing, but has a vision of a woman at a mine entrance where he is his younger self. He wakes Fineas, who, not quite trusting what Pony said about crafting snake rock deterrents, checks them out and mutters under his breath. The only thing he notices is a gentle tug in his chest toward the west, and he also has a vision. Fineas' vision is of a line carrying pails of water into a well; he recognizes that they are of the type that he would have drank from as a mine worker. He grabs one off the line, and the line frays into the periphery of the vision. He drinks from the pail, and feels sand pouring down his throat. The vision ends, and he wakes Slim Jim. Slim Jim also notices nothing in particular, and has a vision of a mining canary succumbing to toxic gases in a mine. He wakes Lark, who is crying for just having a dream of being sat at a table alone, having nothing but ash on his plate. Lark notices nothing during his watch. The party wakes, and Fineas feels a strong magnetic pull from just beneath his sternum towards the west.
