[[Harrigan-Penn Party]] wakes up in their camp a few hours walk from [[Beatstone]]. [[Pony Harrigan]] fails to brew adequate liquor, but makes breakfast for the camp with the help of his hand. They set off towards the town. As they crest a hill and look down on the town, it's clearly emptier than [[Fineas Penn|Fineas]] remembered roughly one year prior, with new structures strewn around the outside of the town. Fineas incorrectly identifies these as grain silos, while Pony knows they are observation towers of some sort. [[Lark]] is learning to count, and practices with the buildings in the town.

[[Harrigan-Penn Party]] enters the town and it is fully evident that it's almost completely empty. As they get deeper into the town, however, Pony and Lark hear some commotion and sprint towards it, the other two following closely behind. They turn a corner and see a woman fighting an aggressive boar. The boar is missing hair in places, with dry, cracked skin. The woman has a similar appearance to her skin in some places, and her wounds ooze black. The party engages the boar. Fineas warns the party not to touch the boar, but not before [[Slim Jim]] has already engaged it in melee combat. Slim Jim is rammed, but manages to not get infected. The rest of the party quickly puts the boar down as Carla charges towards it. She's clearly not a threat, and invites the party back to her home.

Clearly in poor condition, Carla pours herself the last of her alcohol supplies and explains to the party that things were being reanimated and that the watch towers are looking inwards in the town, not out. She explains that the [[Crusaders of Eve]] had installed them, and return every few weeks to cull reanimated bodies (for their own benefit, generally) and bring people down into the quarry. She also recognizes Fineas, which causes the rest of [[Harrigan-Penn Party]] to question him on his history of the town. He explains that he was around when this first started happening. Fineas had been in the mining team that struck the pocket of gas, causing a cave-in of the mines. Fineas was trapped in a pocket with the foreman, who, due to high concentrations of the gas, was infected and turned almost instantly. Fineas had to decapitate him to survive. [[Left Hand of the Foreman|The foreman's left hand]] also came off, and Fineas kept it. When a rescue party finally arrived, the deed had already been done, and people thought Fineas had simply killed the foreman in cold blood; nobody believed his story. Fineas was then exiled from the town, just as others began to become infected.

Fineas feels a pull towards the quarry, and with the others now knowing that it is both the origin of [[Beatstone Plague|the illness]] and the place the Crusaders had been focused on, they decided to investigate and hopefully find what the Crusaders had been so interested in obtaining from it. As they walk towards the quarry, they encounter a few reanimated people in various states of decay. Fineas mourns the first, but afterwards they are able to put them down quickly. At the precipice of the quarry, Fineas hears a muffled voice coming from the Site Manager's station. Slowly entering, Fineas sees the Site Manager with his face partially caved in muttering about the Crusaders taking people in and trying to get something from the quarry. Fineas leaves as soon as the Site Manager notices him, and tells the others. They descend.

Just before the entrance to the quarry, Fineas wraps his scarf tightly around his face and searches for a mining lantern. The rest of the party follows, trying to find scraps of cloth to cover their faces, only finding bandannas worn by miners who had died in the quarry previously and opting not to wear them. They enter the mine shaft. As they descend, Fineas seems more and more drawn, and guides the team through the tunnels. They see bodies coated in some sort of fungus, and the deeper they go, the weaker and more decayed the bodies clearly are. Lark, in a moment of stress and clarity, notices that three people had been entering and only two leaving the tunnels. With Fineas feeling that they "need to go deeper," they all push on. The deeper they go, the less certain the rest of the group becomes, but the more driven Fineas seems to be. They try to stop him at several points, but he slips past them or pushes them to keep going deeper at every attempt.

Eventually, the party reaches the entrance to a large chamber. Fineas recognizes this as the chamber where the cave-in first occurred. The floor is no longer empty or covered in rubble, but rather covered in bodies. Fineas pushes ever forwards, not caring about stepping on bodies. Seeing this, Pony tries to grab Fineas and stop him there, but Fineas simply slides his arm out of Pony's tight grip as though it required no effort at all. The group stays back, training their weapons on Fineas as he approaches a massive mushroom at the back wall. Lark places a disk on Fineas' bag, separating Fineas from his sense of the fungus covering the ground, but not the pull of the Musrhoom itself. Fineas touches it.

Images race through Fineas' mind that he can't make sense of. Marble walkways, striding beasts, and the Crusaders of Eve in Silverton. He tries to communicate back to the mushroom, but can't. While this is happening, bodies rise in the chamber and begin to attack the rest of the party. Slim Jim and Lark avoid infection, but Pony doesn't have the same luck and begins to feel the effects immediately in the chamber, with its high spore concentration. Eventually, Fineas lets go of his guard, and the mushroom latches somewhat onto his mind. This allows him to not only see what the fungus is trying to show him, but to understand as well. He is connected to the whole mycelium network in [[Bleakburgh]], and sees several looping timelines and all that is connected to [[The Void]]. He becomes aware that his understanding of "dead" and "alive" with which he was so concerned after the mine incident was limited by his single consciousness and lived perspective, and that the full gamut of death and life is beyond him. He sees Eve's Cathars set up a civilization in [[Silverton]], holding an authoritarian rule over the town, generally opposed to the freedom Fineas knew in [[Sundance]]. He feels a great energy in the center of [[Darton]] which would give anyone the ability to change the world as they saw fit, and the mushroom makes clear that it believes that no choosing thing should interact with it. With all this, Fineas forgets everything to do with [[Maisie Penn|his sister]], but feels that empty hole in his memory. Finally, he becomes aware of the fighting happening in the background. He decides to rebuke the mushroom. He did not want to bring about the world it had showed him, or aid it in any way.

Fineas decides he must seek out Darton and the source of power within, and bring about a better world in his own image. He will kill the mushroom.

Fineas breaks contact with the mushroom as Lark places a disk on it, causing it to shrink away and appear to almost burn. The bodies drop in the background once more as the others begin to flee. Fineas methodically sets fire to the mushroom with his tinderbox, and the two remaining begin to flee as it rapidly spreads. Lark recalls his disk, causing bodies to reanimate once more and the fire consuming the fungus to be dispelled. It is hurt, but not killed. Lark makes it to the entrance largely unscathed, but Fineas takes repeated hits and just barely makes it out before Pony causes a cave-in, killing the remaining bodies. As the party leaves the mines, they find themselves confronted by a group with torches clad in white robes in gas masks. One of them calls Fineas' name.
