Campaign: [[A Curious Incident at Devil's Crown]]
Setting: [[Auberin]]

Previous Session: [[2025-10-12]]
Next Session: 

# Pre-game preparation
We expect to start this session in initiative. I am at one end of the henge and the rest of the people are at the other, with Amin between us. I have just unconvincingly lied that I had caught Amin in the act of chipping away at the henge with the blade and had taken it from him and backed him away. I asked Declan to help me apprehend Amin, which just barely convinced him thanks to Beolacht's intervention. Mina is suspicious of my having the dagger, and I can only imagine Key is as well. Is Geoffrey here? Unsure. At the end of the last session, sam had said that Declan is running towards me; I am unsure if this was an error (and it's Amin who is charging me), if Declan is "running at me" as in running towards me to assist me with Amin, or if something else is happening.

Threats:
- Amin is the closest to me currently and may be charging at me. He has vested interest in getting me to stop my ritual. He seems intimidating. That said, he seems unarmed and has shown no proposensity for magic. High likelihood, moderate threat.
- Declan seems convinced of my ruse for now. I expect he will be convinced otherwise shortly, if he hasn't already gone mad. Eventually high likelihood, high threat; near-term low-likelihood high threat.
- Mina seems tough and very skeptical of me so far. I have heard rumor that her family performs blood sacrifices to keep the Imps contained. If this is true, she would have interest in seeing my plots foiled if she realizes exactly what has happened. I know she's adept at fighting, and the blood sacrifices hint to some sort of magical ability. Moderate likelihood, high threat.
- Key seems highly skeptical of me and I can only image she is filled with rage upon seeing me with her blade after it has gone missing. She almost certainly does not believe me. I have no idea what her actual capabilities are, but I am inclined to underestimate her in hand-to-hand combat due to her relative size. High likelihood, low threat.

Available Tools:
- 1 Subtle spell left. Should be done on the first cantrip performed that is an attempt to deceive people so the ruse isn't given away instantly.
- Illusory cantrips. Varying abilities. Minor sensory details, or silent imagery that may be able to be moved on action. Utility for deception, probably indirect utility for escape.
- Daily use of [[Charm Person]] or [[Command]] per Sam's addition to my abilities. Favor Charm Person since it lasts longer, prevents direct harm to me, and has broader utility.
- Once-per-rest use of Charming/Frightening within 10 ft of me. Best saved until maximum number of people within radius. Charm preferred unless I just absolutely need to keep people away from me.
- Stone's Endurance. Can use twice as Reaction. Reduce damage taken by 1d12 + CON.
- Little Giant. Prof in Athletics + doubled carry/lift/drag weights.
- Occasional free insight checks via Beolacht if something presents itself to me. Unable to rely on this.
- Eldritch Blast. Actual combat utility. Save as last resort. Try to keep its use to something easily defensible like self-defense.
- Key's dagger. It's ceremonial and probably not built to take real combat abuse, but technically a weapon.
- I DO NOT HAVE: Spell slots, talisman charges, weapons other than Key's dagger.

Strategy Outline:
In order or priority,
1. Comply and keep up the lie. Get people on your side and convince them that they were wrong to doubt you. Return the dagger willingly as a sign of goodwill and answer any questioning. Submit voluntarily to capture if it is requested within reasonable terms.
2. Flee. You are frail and without much combat utility. If they absolutely refuse to let you comply by not believing you or by violently trying to stop you, you ought to flee. By not fighting, you are able to have better odds charming them(?). Your illusory cantrips may aid you.
3. Fight. You're basically a one-trick pony when it comes to actually fighting these people right now. You can do decent damage to the weakest of them, but there are several of them. It's unseen whether the influence on Declan will aid you here.

Specific actions:
- Once-per-day cast [[Charm Person]] on Mina. Mina seems capable and dangerous. Turn the 2 vs. 3 into a 3 vs. 2.
	- This is probably highest priority. Should Mina be an unavailable target, next-highest is probably Amin.
- If brought into custody or otherwise within 10 ft of everyone, use Archfey feature and attempt to charm everyone. THIS ONLY LASTS UNTIL THE END OF YOUR NEXT TURN, SO PERHAPS USE ONLY WHEN YOU KNOW YOU WILL NEED TO CONVINCE THEM.
- Use illusory cantrips to create distractions, screens, etc.
	- Minor Illusion to create some sort of sound that demands attention behind them. Must be within 30 ft
		- The Queen (or someone else) screaming, coming from the entryway.
		- A demonic sound, like rolling screams or impish noises, making their way towards the entryway
		- More rumbling of the sort that brought them up here
	- Silent Image? It seems like it just appears and then only changes appearance if you use a second action to move it; verify with Sam.
		- Could set up a 15-ft-wide head of Beolacht to rise from the edge of the parapet as a distraction
		- Could form some sort of barrier and have it move to appear in front of you to provide you some sort of brief cover?
			- A wall rises out of the ground. A henge appears to tumble. Idk
	- Prestidigitation
		- Cause marks to appear on Amin so he appears demonic somehow to convince others of my story?
		- Create a nonmagical trinket of some kind that helps. THIS WILL ONLY LAST UNTIL THE END OF YOUR NEXT TURN.
			- A faux replica of Key's dagger? Not sure if this "fits within your hand". Give the fake dagger to Key and immediately convince her to put it somewhere safe to buy you time before she realizes it has disappeared.

# Synopsis

- Recap:
	- Haralamb stole the ceremonial knife that Key had crafted for the ceremony to chip away at the henge known as Devil's Crown.
	- Key, Mina, Dahlia, M and Tulip went into the castle and convinced the guards with Key disguised as Finley to look at the body.
	- It goes wrong and Declan runs into the real Finley/the guards who knew where he was. Declan ran into them and Key immediately dropped the disguise and started crying.
	- M stayed in the room when a boom erupted higher up in the tower. The rest went.
	- It was found that Haralamb had begun etching into the henge of Devil's Crown and was confronted by Amin McCormick, the noble M had came to investigate.
	- Amin began speaking to Haralamb about how he should leave the job half-finished and keep the influence and hoodwink Beolacht. Haralamb was like are you fucking stupid.
	- The rest of the party burst in. Haralamb tried to pin it on Amin. He put the murder on Amin.
- We enter with Initiative
	- I roll 18 = dirty 20.
		- I get to go first!
	- I approach Key presenting the dagger and say I believe this is hers.
		- She is somewhat convinced of my ruse. She thinks I am *maybe* telling the truth
	- Q's turn.
		- M considers reading some children's books they thought hinted at a ritual
		- M flips through the pages, not particularly worried about time, seeing if flicking through the pages makes some sort of image or something
		- M kind of spends time rearranging the sentences to make funny words and looking at the typeface.
	- Mina's turn.
		- Mina holds a kitchen knife and tries to do an insight check to see if Amin or Haralamb appears guilty.
			- This is a fucked up scenario. She can't really tell.
		- She points the knife at me and tells me to drop it?
	- Amin's turn.
		- Amin takes a sneak attack despite not having any allies that we can see near him. He attempts to take it against Declan, who is standing immediately behind him.
		- Hits, deals 12 damage with a different dagger.
		- Declan makes a CON save.
			- He fails. 21 points of damage taken, some of it being poison.
		- "Oh yeah, Declan is pretty girl"
		- Declan keels over. His skin pales quickly.
			- Mina recognizes that it looks like what happened to the king.
		- Amin misty steps 30 feet towards the henge.
	- Key's turn.
		- Key moves as close to Amin as possible.
		- Key casts Firebolt on Amin.
			- She hits.
			- He takes 2 damage and lights on fire a little bit.
		- All of us just watched the royal blacksmith's daughter launch fire from her copper rings. Her fingers like glow and then fire erupts from her hands.
	- Declan's turn.
		- CON save. Another 15 damage to Declan.
		- He looks like he's on death's door.
		- He gets up and moves even fucking closer to Amin to try to apprehend him.
			- He attempts a grapple.
			- Amin fails to resist him.
		- Blood pours out of his wounds. He full nelsons Amin to the ground and keeps him steady.
	- Dahlia's turn.
		- Dahlia moves forwards and makes an Arcana check as an action.
		- She is able to tell that there are, in fact, runes on the henge. Other people don't know that. She can kind of figure out that whatever Haralamb was doing was deliberate.
		- Dahlia warns not to trust Haralamb.
	- Tulip's turn.
		- Tulip makes an attack roll against the thing tying her to Dahlia.
		- She moves to Haralamb and attempts to make a shove attack against him.
			- She barely hits him and tells him he's being shady.
	- Haralamb's turn.
		- I move past Tulip. She tries to bat at me as I move past. I tell her to back off, I have a dagger to return.
		- I approach Key.
		- I attempt to subtle spell, once-per-day charm person Dahlia. It fails because of a ruling that I am "fighting" her.
			- She hit a nat 20 on her second die. She notices some sort of presence she has felt before and that Haralamb has focused more strongly on her.
		- I turn around and pass the dagger off the Key.
	- M's turn.
		- Key examines the stories some more. All of them talk about the Fey having been sealed. Their reading seems to show that some sort of material could have different effects; it is always said not that the seal is unbreakable but that steel couldn't break it. They don't connect all the dots but they connect that the boom upstairs might have been someone trying to do something.
		- M heads towards the guard office downstairs, further from the henge.
		- M talks to Finley. They talk about the boom, and how the knife went missing
			- "There was like a big explosion, and that's where Devil's Crown is"
			- "So there's a door, and you blow the door up, and then what?"
				- It's Open
					- Do we want Devil's Crown open?
						- NO......
		- M convinces Finley to rally the guards.
	- Amin's turn
		- He attempts to break out of the grapple.
		- He fails. He remains stuck in Declan's grasp.
	- Mina's turn
		- Mina moves towards Declan, getting up to about the rest of the group but not quite reaching him.
		- She chooses to hold her action:
			- If/when Amin breaks the grapple, she wants to use an attack. Technically will be a bonus action.
	- Key's turn.
		- OOC she asks about its stats. It's ceremonial, its cutting ability is less than the kitchen knives because it is delicate. Deals 1 dmg straight, but deals 1d4 plus prof against Fey.
		- She approaches Declan and Amin.
		- She attempts to cast Cure Wounds on Declan.
			- She gives him 11 hp

			- He takes 7, down to 6 hp
		- He tries to keep Amin grappled.

			- She hits.
			- Would do 9 dmg + 2

	- Tulip's turn
		- "Oh, is it time?"

		- He casts eldritch blast on Dahlia. Rays that blot out the light around them hit her for 1 damage.
		- I run away behind a wall to break line of sight with Tulip
	- M's turn
		- They tell they additional guards about the boom from Devil's Crowns and who has all run up there. They say to send as many guards as possible or they're all going to die.
		- Norris, a guard, is being real slow to respond. Finley calls him a Dunce and M says "you're the one saying that"
		- "So you're telling me, the indestructible, unscratchable monument has been cracked open? And you expect me to skip me lunch break to deal with it?"
			- There isn't time for this, I didn't want to tell you. I'm part of the secret agency of guards that works underground in the neural network. This is very important, look, I have documentation.
				- M holds up some sort of paper. The guard says it looks like paper and hands him something and all the guards start going towards Devil's Crown.
		- "I just think I need to be less gullible is the thing?"
		- M and this guard have a really unfulfilling back and forth about who's gullible and the guard asks if they like theater.
		- M leaves.
	- Amin's turn
		- Attempts to break grapple, nat 1, loses turn
	- Mina's turn
		- Hold action again for Amin to break grapple.
	- Key's turn
		- She approaches Amin and tries to bonk him on the head with her hammer.
			- Nat 20
			- She does a surprising amount of damage with her hammer. He screams and swears in pain.
