Previous Session: [[2025-10-12]]
Next Session: 

# Pre-game preparation
We expect to start this session in initiative. I am at one end of the henge and the rest of the people are at the other, with Amin between us. I have just unconvincingly lied that I had caught Amin in the act of chipping away at the henge with the blade and had taken it from him and backed him away. I asked Declan to help me apprehend Amin, which just barely convinced him thanks to Beolacht's intervention. Mina is suspicious of my having the dagger, and I can only imagine Key is as well. Is Geoffrey here? Unsure. At the end of the last session, sam had said that Declan is running towards me; I am unsure if this was an error (and it's Amin who is charging me), if Declan is "running at me" as in running towards me to assist me with Amin, or if something else is happening.

Threats:
- Amin is the closest to me currently and may be charging at me. He has vested interest in getting me to stop my ritual. He seems intimidating. That said, he seems unarmed and has shown no proposensity for magic. High likelihood, moderate threat.
- Declan seems convinced of my ruse for now. I expect he will be convinced otherwise shortly, if he hasn't already gone mad. Eventually high likelihood, high threat; near-term low-likelihood high threat.
- Mina seems tough and very skeptical of me so far. I have heard rumor that her family performs blood sacrifices to keep the Imps contained. If this is true, she would have interest in seeing my plots foiled if she realizes exactly what has happened. I know she's adept at fighting, and the blood sacrifices hint to some sort of magical ability. Moderate likelihood, high threat.
- Key seems highly skeptical of me and I can only image she is filled with rage upon seeing me with her blade after it has gone missing. She almost certainly does not believe me. I have no idea what her actual capabilities are, but I am inclined to underestimate her in hand-to-hand combat due to her relative size. High likelihood, low threat.

Available Tools:
- 1 Subtle spell left. Should be done on the first cantrip performed that is an attempt to deceive people so the ruse isn't given away instantly.
- Illusory cantrips. Varying abilities. Minor sensory details, or silent imagery that may be able to be moved on action. Utility for deception, probably indirect utility for escape.
- Daily use of [[Charm Person]] or [[Command]] per Sam's addition to my abilities. Favor Charm Person since it lasts longer, prevents direct harm to me, and has broader utility.
- Once-per-rest use of Charming/Frightening within 10 ft of me. Best saved until maximum number of people within radius. Charm preferred unless I just absolutely need to keep people away from me.
- Stone's Endurance. Can use twice as Reaction. Reduce damage taken by 1d12 + CON.
- Little Giant. Prof in Athletics + doubled carry/lift/drag weights.
- Occasional free insight checks via Beolacht if something presents itself to me. Unable to rely on this.
- Eldritch Blast. Actual combat utility. Save as last resort. Try to keep its use to something easily defensible like self-defense.
- Key's dagger. It's ceremonial and probably not built to take real combat abuse, but technically a weapon.
- I DO NOT HAVE: Spell slots, talisman charges, weapons other than Key's dagger.

Strategy Outline:
In order or priority,
1. Comply and keep up the lie. Get people on your side and convince them that they were wrong to doubt you. Return the dagger willingly as a sign of goodwill and answer any questioning. Submit voluntarily to capture if it is requested within reasonable terms.
2. Flee. You are frail and without much combat utility. If they absolutely refuse to let you comply by not believing you or by violently trying to stop you, you ought to flee. By not fighting, you are able to have better odds charming them(?). Your illusory cantrips may aid you.
3. Fight. You're basically a one-trick pony when it comes to actually fighting these people right now. You can do decent damage to the weakest of them, but there are several of them. It's unseen whether the influence on Declan will aid you here.

Specific actions:
- Once-per-day cast [[Charm Person]] on Mina. Mina seems capable and dangerous. Turn the 2 vs. 3 into a 3 vs. 2.
	- This is probably highest priority. Should Mina be an unavailable target, next-highest is probably Amin.
- If brought into custody or otherwise within 10 ft of everyone, use Archfey feature and attempt to charm everyone. THIS ONLY LASTS UNTIL THE END OF YOUR NEXT TURN, SO PERHAPS USE ONLY WHEN YOU KNOW YOU WILL NEED TO CONVINCE THEM.
- Use illusory cantrips to create distractions, screens, etc.
	- Minor Illusion to create some sort of sound that demands attention behind them. Must be within 30 ft
		- The Queen (or someone else) screaming, coming from the entryway.
		- A demonic sound, like rolling screams or impish noises, making their way towards the entryway
		- More rumbling of the sort that brought them up here
	- Silent Image? It seems like it just appears and then only changes appearance if you use a second action to move it; verify with Sam.
		- Could set up a 15-ft-wide head of Beolacht to rise from the edge of the parapet as a distraction
		- Could form some sort of barrier and have it move to appear in front of you to provide you some sort of brief cover?
			- A wall rises out of the ground. A henge appears to tumble. Idk
	- Prestidigitation
		- Cause marks to appear on Amin so he appears demonic somehow to convince others of my story?
		- Create a nonmagical trinket of some kind that helps. THIS WILL ONLY LAST UNTIL THE END OF YOUR NEXT TURN.
			- A faux replica of Key's dagger? Not sure if this "fits within your hand". Give the fake dagger to Key and immediately convince her to put it somewhere safe to buy you time before she realizes it has disappeared.
