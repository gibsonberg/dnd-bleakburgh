# Synopsis

- Reputation mechanic; a critical failure (<=5) lowers reputation, critical success (>=20) increase reputation
- MY STANDING REPUTATION AT THE BEGGINING OF THIS SESSION: 2
- We open to beautifully paved royal road, very nicely kept. A carriage travels down the road, white horses, gilded bridles. We zoom into a royal carriage
- Kendra's char:
	- Short, 5' tall, dark hair except two blonde chunky streaks in the front, intense makeup
		- Dark blue dress, lighter blues and blacks accents, etc.
		- Intricate wrapping around arm ending in guantlet
	- Her sister, elegant updo, dress, poised, reaches into a dress pocket and gets a flask.
		- Tulip's hair is bright blonde.
	- "I do despise these gatherings. There's never anyone to romance, is  there?"
	- "Have you tried being less picky?"
		- Darling, ... that's like asking the sky to be less blue
	- What if you found someone you can just romance here and then abandon them forever
		- That's what I usually do, etc.
	- Sister: People are so nasty to you... My role is to set you up with somebody
	- Father tips in... "Girls there are truly so many rumors about our family, if you could just for once not engage in debauchery... Dahlia, my dearest child, I really don't like to see them pick on you"
		- Papa, listen, if they have so many rumors about us, they can never knoow whats real
			- I have an estate to maintain though,
				- But it makes life more fun
			- Dahlia, I do love you... but osmetimes you make decision that are reckless for the famly. You know I'm behind you but THE MONARCH is going to be there. This isn't like back home.
		- We're really trying to impress them?
			- YES, was there a question mark at the end of that?
			- ...keep the table dances to TWO this time. Last time we were pushing ten.
				- Three?
					- Fine, three
	- Mother: Edwin dea, she's going to do what she's going to do. Just let her
		- Kednra: get a load of this guy (to sister)
	- They look out the carriage at Devil's Crown. The peaks, barely in the hills they make out the palace.
	- Her family's coat of arms:
- We pan to a cobbled road, skies are grayer. It comes in from the south. No golden bridles and silk, iron and black fabric. Sadie's character:
	- Wilhemina is a very serious woman, early 20s, serious nose and dark eyes, braids at front with beads at the bottom, high-necked tunic with ceremonial leather, long sleeves, gloves, black leather pants and boots
	- She is an only child, her mother and father sit across from her dressed to the nines with tightly buttoned collars. Every crease as though it has just been unpackaged
	- Her father speaks with an uncommon tenderness: "You know, sigh, you know... the Dawes family is going to be there."
		- Yes father
			- We have to keep up appearances
				- I suppose, I dont know why its so important to go through trivial nonsense
			- Crane (the current monarch) is a fan of tradition in a way that I don't care for. I only care for practical tradition as you know. Should the Dawes boy try to start something, remain above it.
				- Maybe I'll just finish waht I started last time.
					- Tell you what, at best, he tries to d osomething, you can break his nose. Something that will heal. Only if he starts it
	- Alessandra(?): can we avoid fighting, dear, at all, if we can help it? You're very talented, very good, but the boy is soft skinned.
		- I will not do anything unprompted
			- That worries me dear, unprompted, can we please just... for once... The monarch has his faults but I think it would be good if we as a family could garner some good faith
				- Mina looks at her dad liike "okayyyyy"
					- He looks at her mother lovingly.. 
					  Mina
						- Yes mother, I will be on my best behavior
- Pan away to an unpaved dirt road coming from the north.
	- Hardly a carriage, not royal horses, mules pulling uncovered wooden wagon, though fitted with alloys. The equipment is soot-covered. A sight anywhere in auberin, its own kind of decadence.
	- Andie's character:
		- One of like a million siblings, the only one they brought. Oldest of like 9. 
		- ACtively still working in the carriage
		- Scrawny, 16 yo girl, but tall and lanky. She has an odd amount of muscle definition in her arms for her age because of labor. Tons of braids an dpains in her hair an d self-made jewelry.
		- Her hair is pinned up in various places haphazardly for practicality. So many knots in her hair. Welding goggles, soot marks from welding ash, white as a ghost, so nervous.
	- With one worker and her father, Sioan.
	- Father: "RIght, so:"
	- My dear daughter, you're presenting this ceremonial dagger, you've earned your rest. Do you know what an honor that is? How old I was? So long since our family presented something like this for the kingdom.
		- I remember
			- You cant be saying shiit like that in thek ingdom, theyl thing we're crazy
		- I'm already making it perfect
			- I know, youre me daughter, your skill is unmatched, perhaps surpassing my own
	- We've got to be careful. It's been decades since anyone from Norhtburn has been allowed in the castle.
		- You've got a brash sense of humor. You get that from your father. ... essentially lock in
			- She uses the phrasee "I'm chilling" and she says its a phrase young people use, he notes its ironic becasuse of where htey are from
	- You're going to drive this into the cake... they usually have the monarch do that.
		- I'm nervous... I already peed a little bit.
			- She asks the attendant if she brought extra pants.. of course.
	- I'm gonna be presenting the cake (the attendant)... it's really all about, youre only gonna be up there for 30 seconds. Just worry about posture and silence, stab the cake. Don't squeal when they do it.... Key... I love you but Eve above I am worried
		- The attendant is 30 and all of her hair is gray
	- Key is pretty transparent that she's trying to make her father proud and feel confident in her abilities.
		- He doesn't get HOW nervous she is but notices her pallor. He places her hand on the back of her neck and looks at her: "Key, you make me proud you know, no matter what you do... Give them hell, you know, figuratively"
	- See alabster walls, petrified wood, a massive tree
- Pan to a commoner's wagon, kept together with woodne pegs, also uncovered
	- My character.

				- You were not especially kind to Amin McCormick (recently appointed governor of the easternmost town)
					- Q's character is progressive for Auberin, doesn't like his tradition. Want a sneak peak int othe next article?
					- In general, it's gonna be on how the tithes from Amin about some possible fraud and those taxes should go to what the people care about and need
						- So it's an exposee?
							- Well, strong wording, the monarchy would kill me(?) or the agency taken down. Calling it a question, open receipts for the people. More transparency from the government.
		- This person is a leatherworker, has just been trusting the government for how things are allocated.
			- Q suggests the worker unionize, etc. They say they will, and gets the name: Ivan's Leatherworks in First Foray
- We zoom up and over, the day grows long, the shadows stretch out, scattered farms and townships outside Devil's Crown.
	- As each carriage moves into and through the city, you see a number of things: covered markets, libraries, this is the center of everything that's happening in Auberin.
	- One of the only places outside of First Foray with embassies: Arulon, notably no Kallanda, Whatudi Empire(?)
- The inner buildings are of rougher stone not because of lack of funds but age. It all rises up and up, it gets incredibly steep requiring pulleys for transport as it gets higher and higher until we reach a point
	- Devil's Crown Palace.
	- It towers above the innermost wall. Palatial base, square, within which there are servan'ts quarters and such. Even further along, it rises to a single spire. There are courtyards, halls, hedges immaculately kept.
	- As each cart enters the innermost gate, a heavy wrought iron lowers and opens only for each new arrival
	- We all are gathered with a host of people in a welcome hall/foyer just past the outer gardens.

	- Q's character asks a servant if they're indentured. They explain they have no pay but are given what they wish for their service, very comfortable
	- Key has changed out of piss pants into nice clothes. Seeing the atmosphere in the castle and how it functions. She has a fancy chest and shoulder plate, armor.
	- When we all walked in, we met a very built knight in armor.
		- The head of the royal gaurd, Declan Oseanassy, goes "there will be no weapons here in the castle. You will turn out your pockets before I let you into the castle"
		- He doesn't do a thorough search of most of us, except Dalia
			- He gives her a hard time about having weapons and she just goes.. "No?"
				- She mentions the double standards and he lets her in
		- He checks Mina. She doesn't try to hide her rapier. He appreciates it. Her father butts in and intimidates him... "best keep your duties quick rather than thorough"
			- Mina tries to sneak past with more weapons an someone(?) catches her and her father is disappointed in her. She turns out her socks, etc. and her dad pushes them hard into Declan's chest
		- Key is next in line and sees this.
			- Her dad recognizes Declan and goes on about last he saw him he was a wee man. Declan is not amused and so on, he needs to do his job
			- Key presents the dagger in its paperwork. Declan thanks her, this of course is permitted, we will keep this in the kitchen.
			- Key is silent. She is welcomed in as an honored guests.
			- She pounds her chest in appreciation and Declan tries to mimic it awkwardly
			- Her dad tells Declan he's excited to be in the castle doing some chilling, really leaning into it. Declan doesn't get the term.
				- Mina and other people her age pick up on it and talk about it amongst themselves
		- I am next.
			- Declan gives us trouble to start. He  has people come by to help check our retinue.
			- Haralamb shoots a glare back at the group intending to keep them from getting rowdy and Geoffrey starts lauding Haralamb.
			- The monarch walks up and tells Declan off for giving us trouble.
			- Haralamb bows.
		- Q's character, Marilyn is next.
			- "Are you the Declan Oseanassy. I always thought that they exaggerated"
			- They grab his shoulder and he tells them to keep their hands off his armor
			- Marilyn asks about Declan's routine, makes some bad puns, "pen is mightier than the sword"
			- Declan lets him in.
- We are all in the castle.
	- We are ushered out of the welcome hall into the ballroom. It is cavernous with grand sconces and chandeliers. Mosaics depict Auberinian history for each of the families
	- Declan is out of his armor into military dress.
	- Everyone milling about.
	- Kendra's sister mentions there's a lot of talent to her
		- She mentions Declan; Dalia says he's so orderly.
		- "You're going to have to tell me who you're interested in for me to have a hope in doing this"
			- Dalia says it might be more fun for her to take the lead
				- "I need some parameters"
					- Not Declan
		- She offers someone else, The Dawes Boy, she isn't terribly excited about him. They're focused on statecraft, not sport.
			- "You found someone uptight, someone who can sing I guess"
		- She gestures at Mina, "what about..? I WOULD."
			- Mina sees this gesture and the talking. She stands awkwardly with her champagne.
		- Her sister feels like she's mentioning every possible thing she could
		- She mentions Haralamb... "you know like... scary hot?"
			- Dalia is kind of into that
		- She mentions Key but then says she's too young "I wouldn't"
		- Geoffrey walks up and asks for a dance but mentions he will need to be taught. He is saying this tooo who?
	- We pan to Geoffrey and Haralamb speaking about how Geoffrey keeps striking out

		- Marilyn is looking for her.
			- Marilyn 100% sees where Key goes. She went alone to talk to Penny
			- Marilyn is chatting with various people as they leave the room.
			- Marilyn is not trying to be sneaky. They aren't beelining for Key but is definitely going in that direction.
	- Back to Dalia
		- Tulip asks if they'll be talking to the woman.
			- Dalia says it would be good for Tulip and goes on about the suggestions.
			- Dalia wants to have fun dancing on tables; all Tulip's suggestions are people who want to talk to her 
			- Connor Crane tugs on her sleeve and in a high voice says he'd like to dance on the table too (he is 10)
			- Dalia is going to go dance on tables with Connor. She mentions this can be one of her 3 and he has no limit. They go to get his father to see if he will dance on tables with them. Her mother is muttering about it.
			- The nanny in earshot kind of gives up on stopping Connor
			- He thinks she's 15. She says Connor should go around and tell people that.
	- Tulip goes up to Mina
		- Tulip: "I don't usually tell this to people, I saw what you did to that Dawes boy, it really was something"
		- "You are an exceptionally tall glass of water" they exchange names and Tulip kisses her hand.
		- Mina points out her sister trying to get on a table. "That's one of 3 for the night" Tulip says
		- Tulip thinks it was humorous Cory Dawes thought he could take Mina in a fight.
		- They go on talking about his eyepatch, how bad he is in combat, etc.
		- "I'm looking for someone I can set my sister up with..."
			- Tulip says she'd like to take Mina for herself. Mina says she couldve been clearer. Tulip says she's said it
		- Mina asks what Dalia's type is. Tulip doesn't know. Nice, want's to dance on the table with her - not the 10 year old -  she doesn't even know if she's interested in a man or a woman.
			- Dalia didn't like the door boy. Tulip points out another soldier boy from one of the lower families, uniform kind of wearing him.
				- Mina stares at him and walks up to the guard and speaks to him
					- "The name's Finley"
						- How do you feel about women who dance on tables, like that one (Dalia)
							- Ay she's quite fit
						- Adn if she told you she wanted to dance on tables what would you do
							- I wouldn't stop her , if it was permitted
						- Mina tries to bring him over and he tries to refuse because he's at his post. She drags him and he drinks a little.
	- Cut to Dalia
		- She and Connor have walked up to Morgan and starts saying the stuff they talked about
		- The monarch tells Connor shes in her 20s.
		- Dalia brings up they're talking about table dancing and the monarch gets excited. "everybody's kind of rude to you"
			- "Are we under the dominion of the imps? Dance on the table if you like!"
		- "Monarch Morgan.."
			- just call me morgan! I'm not your father, I'm just a guy!
				- "Do you think we should convince everyone here that it's opposite day and instead of dancing on the floor they dance on the tables"
			- Dalia is worried everyone thinks shhes sent by the imps
				- Nobody has spoke n to the Imps, the big guy, in ages. sometimes you get nightmares and scratches in the night and i am a haunted man, but i know youre not
			- Dalia says Declan was mean and stuck up
				- Morgan can talk to him
				- Dalia asks if Morgan can get Declan with some of his guards, some cider, and convince everyone that it's opposite day and have them dance on the tables.
				- Morgan mentions he's a haunted man. I overhear
					- I am circling in mild stealth. I appear next to them.
						- She screams
					- Formal greeting to the king.
						- They mention their plan
						- I agree and to grab Geoffrey
	- The king sets a new tune and the plan begins, with Geoffrey
		- Geoffrey is into it, going to do the Kallandan shuffle
	- Circle back to Marilyn going to speak to Key
		- Key walks out into an empty corridor and looks around. Nobody is looking, she thinks. She's so overwhelmed and just wants to hang out with her bestie.
		- Key tosses an ornate metal fold and it becomes a cow construct, full sized.
			- This is Penny, a copper toned shaggy highland cow made of metal
			- Penny is her bestie.
		- Key pressed her head against Penny's. "Fuck it's hot in there"
			- Penny shakes in agreement
		- Marilyn, "I thought I'd find you out here"
			- They looks like Saorise
			- Key tries to inspect Saorise a bit. It seems like her but she's down with a cold.
			- "Oh I'm alright, but mor eimportantly how are you?"
				- Marilyn forgets Penny's name but Penny doesn't know.
			- "You're still a little nervous"
				- Well it's my first time here, everyone seems to know what they're doing and I'm just here.
				- It will be fine and we can go home
			- Right, all you need is to cut that cake isn't that right kiddo
				- Don't you think it would be good to go through the motions one more time, get the swing of the knife
					- She doubts its necessary, etc but is convinced. They head chef has it, it could be polished one mor etime
			- Are you sure they'll be receptive of Penny?
				- Penny shifts to become a breastplate and folds back onto her.
					- "Unfortunately I was your plus one hahaha"
						- Hahhh right...
			- Someone walks up, eventually Key asks if she can see the head chef again to shine the dagger. They reassure her it's probably fine.
			- Marilyn is like 'I don't mean to be pushy my dear boy'
				- Do you have a little routine you do maybe before a night watch that maybe helps ground you or calm you down.
					- I meditate for about half an hour... sit in silence, perfectly still, think about the oath I've taken
						- "What do you do!" - Key
							- I believe we should all do the one thing that grounds us, itseems that for you it's meditation, and the  reason I ask about the knoife is it brings her that sense of meditation. So if you could think of it as finding a way to center herself.
								- I dont think we can let you polish it
									- "truthfully I think its good. It's alright"
			- Marilyn embarrasses Key (by maybe suggesting something romantic? I missed) in front of this guard(?) (yes, Declan) and they both head inside.
	- Marilyn is alone in the hallway alone. COmpletely alone, does away with the disguise.
	- Key goes back in and sees if she sees Saorise. She does not.
- We come back inside and everyone is on the tables.
	- The king is pretending to be animals.
		- Haralamb is very enthused with this and guesses them all right.
	- The king goes to get his wife and see if they can kiss.
	- ! lady crane's name is Maive
		- She's very pretty
	- Marilyn goes over to a corner and is furiously writing trying to get an extra out about all the royals eating off of the floor
		- A gentleman next to them, unamused with the whole thing
	- Key goes up to Mina and sees that all her weapons got taken away. She offers to craft a rapier for Mina.
		- They introduce themselves to one another. Mina compliments Key's dagger. She asks if she's nervous.
			- I was but I decided that's for girls and I'm a woman.
				- Mina can see that she's frusrated and sweaty, out of place, not sure how to act
		- Mina offers Key her hand.
			- She takes it. Mina drags Key onto a table with her.
	- Dalia looks for her mom in the crowd. She has switched to water. She says her mom looks like the weird one now
		- I love when my daughter makes a fool of me
	- Marilyn (A to Z Times) asks the guy next to him loudly enough that the mom can hear: Bonnie heir ruins evening, dances on tables, makes guests eat off floor
		- He looks over and he's talking to Amin
			- Amin gives Marilyn 3 questions
				- People are questioning your lineage. ("Statement" "Im not done yet" "Okay make itsnappy thrn)
				- What do you have to say for those questioning your sudden ascent to the throne, claiming youre not worthy"
					- First of all a governor doesn't sit on a throne. I think sometimes your dad has a kid you don't know about and shit gets crazy with your heirs
				- Do you wear boxers or briefs?
					- I wear silkk briefs (exasperated with this)
				- Are you misallocating tithes to increase wealth for your own personal family?
					- Insight check, 11.
					- He has deep annoyance at this question. Many people has questioned his legitimacy.
					- Does it look like I need to? Gestures broadly
				- I know us reporters may seem a little annoying but you can think of me as being on your side.
				- I don't want rumors to spread, I want the truth. It seems to me that those rumors about tithes, are, well, rumors!
					- Intim check. 12
					- He gets real close and pulls Marilyn in by his collar and threatens him that the guards are there to protect him. Watch your mouth and keep your nose where it belongs.
					- Pushes them out
				- Given your response I'm starting to believe you, but that reaction changed my mind.
				- Can you just sign here?
					- No
				- Ill just write that for you thanks
	- Finely comes up to Dalia
		- You're the lass that orchestrated this whole table dance?
		- It's awkward but Finley thinks Dalia is quite pretty and well above his station. If it's overstepping, she would tell him .... he asks for a dance.
			- Yes, and, Geoffrey was going to teach them a dance.
				- Sure, they can all dance together.
					- Don't take it as disinterest, wanna come meet Geoffrey
	- Geoffrey is not picky (telling to a different group)
	- Geoffrey is 29 terrified of being 30
	- Dalia gets Geoffrey to teach them the Kallandan Shuffle
		- It's crazy. Dalia rejects it because she has a dress on.
		- She suggests Finley dance. He rolls a 13 performance. It's his first time doing it, but he gives it a solid go.
	- Haralamb make sit towards the kitchen
		- a
		- I am seemingly unfollowed. The first thing I see upon arriving is the head chef. I am almost seen by the head chef
		- I cast invisibility within the kitchen
			- There is an ornate box wrapped in very finely woven bow.
			- The dagger is beautiful, almost blidningly reflective. Accents of gold twisting and turning, it is razor thin, etc. Cearly crafted by someone with decades of experience
			- I take my peek and go to put it away and slink out
			- whispers
			- I STEAL THE DAGGER AND SWAP IT FOR THE NICEST LOOKING KNIFE
			- I use my hour to sneak it into my belongings and return to the party
		- I make it back to the dining hall and it it massive, extravagant, people are filing in.
- We arrive at the dinner.
	- Marilyn, Mina, Dalia are looking at guests coming and going.
		- They see me walking in separate from Geoffrey into the banquet hall
	- Dalia walks in with Geoffrey and Finley, her sister is impressed
	- Tulip beckons for Mina to come sit by her and she does to the dismay of her parents
	- Her parents are disappointed, casting glares, pissed.
	- Monarch is at the head of the table
		- 15 ft away from Dalia, no chance of her shimmying up closer
		- Morgan says they've had a lot of fun, danced on tables, eaten off the floor, it's been a hell of a night. He calls for Maive and she asks him to get on with the ceremony because Connor needs to be to bed by a certain time.
		- Key is sitting next to the king, father on one side and Saorise further down the table
	- "now is the time we reenact the form of ceremony in the form of sharing in delicacies with one another, descendants of the first families. all of our predecessors fought against the imps. I know (gets serious in a way a few of us have seen)"
	- He looks hard at a spot in the table.
	- "Its a miracle were allowed to live in this fair country of Auberin. the Imps punished our ancestors in ways we do not forget. It is our brave predecessors, the Helfigs, those who fought on the front lines; The Bonnies, those who coordinated places for those injured to rest; The Dawes, those that collect resources; the McCormicks who kept correspondance w/ the ships in the harbor; the McConnollies, those who learned thesecrets of the Imps and how we might destroy them; and teh Cranes who first mediated, however bloody, the first meetings with the imps."
	- "It is in this moment we honor the sacrifice, the ?, and the prosperity of our fair nation. and we do so with an honor we have not had in quite some time. Something we did not think we would have for quite some time."
	- "The Farrigan lineage of Northburn in the Valley of Cinders has graced our presence today. These fine people are not just laborers, they are tasked with some of the most sacred duties in this land, the wielding of fire. It is with no small honor I am here to present a dagger crafted by Key Farrigan"
	- Applause, support from Key's father
	- "Chef Emmer, if you would present the ceremonial knife. Key you have the honor of plunging the knife into this delicacy to symbolize the way we drove back the Imp threat"
	- BEHOLD THE CEREMONIAL KNIFE FOR THIS DAY
		- The silk ribbon is untied
		- Morgan takes the lid off the box and looks and goes "hm"
		- With no less reverence, holds it up, and her and her father look at each other in shock
	- "This craft is made with the utmost humility and earthly wisdom that those working out of Northburn have mustered for us this day"
		- Key has tears streaming down her face
			- "Dear girl, it's a good knife."
				- No, it was great.
					- Welll.....
				- It's 
					- That's not my knife
				- What?
					- ITS NOT MY KNIFE
		- Her father goes to her
			- He tells her it might be time to sit down for the time being to let the ceremonyh continue
	- Marilyn butts in
		- "THIS IS HIGHLY YUNORHTODOX WHO ARE YOU"
			- I am with the A to Z times, it is rather lackluster, she sad it was not her knife, id like to lear nabout that
				- The knife I was instructed to craft for this ceremony was gilded and started out as a chunk of titanium I harvested myself, poured, and melted over and over again.
				- This is a butter knife
					- It's very shapr for one ,but....
				- I don't know what to tellyou, I would never present you with such a knife
				- You're welcome to continue the ceremony with this knife, but I would never craft something this lame
	- The crowd is aghast. Haralamb does not draw attention to himself. There's gossip abnout slang and Key being a chiller. Marilyn is eagerly writing this down.
	- Mina's father gets up walk to the table, and puts a hand on Mina's back and tells the gossipers to shut up.
	- Key looks to her dad
		- He stands up and speaks
			- "Royal folk of the court while I of course have not been permitted to see the knife myself, I have seen her work, and it is nothing worse than exceptional. this is NOT her knife"
				- Key leaves in embarrassment
	- Marilyn suggests maybe she does kind of suck.
		- People boo them and they suggest theft would be a better story
		- Key's dad tells Marilyn to SHUT HIS FUCKING MOUTH and lauds her skills and calls him a pissant who writes a tabloid
		- Marilyn quotes him all he likes fucking bastard
			- Key hears this in the hallway
		- Key cries to her father about how she would never do something that stupid.
			- He thinks the monarch is seeking to make a fool of her and they are going to make it right somehow.
			- Key says the monarch seems true but is sometimes all over the place but she just doesn't know. She needs to be alone.
