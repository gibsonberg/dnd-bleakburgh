Campaign: [[A Curious Incident at Devil's Crown]]
Setting: [[Auberin]]

Next Session: 

# Synopsis

Auberin, a monarchy, not particularly capitalist. Socialist monarchy??? Several subdivisions within the nation. Governor and a capital in Devil's Crown. Resources distributed to territories according to need. Fire is limited due to a perpetual autumn(?) except in one part where it is safe to use it, so in some areas bioluminescent organisms are used and such. The Valley of Cinders, where fire is allowed, is very much a sort of company town; lots of responsibility to supply the nation with materials but not much in the way of squalor, just lots of labor.

Political system. Each governing head in each town is descended from the original families that came to Auberin, which was unoccupied save for the presence of what Auberanians call "Imps," fey-like creatures which are chaotic and destructive. Menacing, killed a lot of people when the first families arrived.

The First Foray is both the name of a peninsula in Auberin where the first settlement developed (and where a lot of people died) and

Campaign takes place roughly 700 years before [[Dungeons and Deserts]], 400 years before the inception of Bleakburgh, ~500 years after First Foray slaughter.  We will be starting in the capital, Devil's Crown. This town used to be a massive tree in the heart of the nation. In discovering the weaknesses of the imps, they families burned the tree to the ground. It is now a petrified series of concentric circles within which the city is built. In the very center is Devil's Crown, a henge built ~400 years prior. It took about a century to claim the country from the imps. Some say this henge IS Devil's Crown. It is made of stone and draws on four nodes built at the extremes of each cardinal direction on the continent. It binds imps to the space and they exist in what they call The Passage, between reality and the Void. The imps act like Lesser Deities, but humans are on their radar. The nodes were there when the first families arrived; Imps could not exist elsewhere in the world. The families researched the nodes.

The monarchy exists to keep the Imps at bay. The monarch is chosen from one of these 13 families. Yes, they are the ruler, they are also tasked with communing with the Imps as they appear within the henge. Thus it's kind of a burden to be tasked with the role. The 13 families are generally comfortable in their seats of governance and don't particularly vie for the seat as the monarch.

We will start at a dinner party, the monarch has just been murdered. Lockdown, gates shut, etc.

There was a being who once the most powerful of the Imps, known as Beolacht who was called the Devil King. The reason the gulf is named after him is because only he was powerful enough to travel out over the sea, learned as new ships arrived and were capsized. The rumors are that the only imp to manifest within Devils Crown is Beolacht.
