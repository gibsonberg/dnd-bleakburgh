# Synopsis

- REPUTATION:
	- Marilyn has dropped to 1. Disadvantage on all persuasion checks and insight checks made in this setting, addl. effects.
	- Dahlia gained by 1, up to 4. Advantage against anyone not actively dislike her
	- Haralamb has remained the same, 2
	- Key has gone down by 1, disadvantage on persuasion and insight checks with ppl who dislike her.
	- Mina has remained the same.
- Recap: Went to Devil's Crown, immediately met monarch. Dahlia befriended king's young child. Marylin/Marvin impersonated Saorise in front of Key and embarrassed Declan by implying he and Key should dance. During the table danc,e Haralamb went off alone and stole the ceremonial dagger, replacing it with a fancy kitchen knife. Dahlia rizzed up two people at once. It was revealed at the dinner that the real knife was gone, and it broke out into pandemonium. Several guests slipped out when the monarch went to console his wife. She returned, screaming the husband was murdered. Key is in the garden, Marilyn went out to find her. Declan has declared nobody is allowed in or out of the castle.
- My plan: I must escape this locked room. I can cast invisibility with subtle spell when attention is off of me to leave.
- We return to the garden.
	- Key is laying on Penny, depressed.
	- Marilyn is sitting around, patient. Waiting for something to happen.
		- Investigates Key. She is deflated, retreated. She's becoming a woman but in this moment she is a scared kid. Her impulse was to run and hide and avoid the chaos.
		- She has completed wittling 6 knives.
		- Marvin can't be 100% certain the knife wasn't really Key's, but this is not a kid embarrassed by the knife not living up; it's the adults don't believe her.
		- The knives look so much cooler and more beautiful than the one at the dinner.
	- BONG BONG BONG
		- A litany of yelling along the castle walls from everywhere.
			- Marvin: That can't be good
			- Key: screams, Do you think they heard about my knife?
			- No, no, I don't think so. Not yet. Probably about something else, don't worry. I believe you.
			- Marvin hears someone yell "THE KING IS DEAD", Key doesn't
			- Did you hear that? No, I don't think they heard about your knife. I believe that wasn't your knife. Speaking of, you should probably put the wooden ones someone else and we should go back, I think the king was murdered.
			- Nonononon, I heard you... HOW? *screams* She puts on penny as they head towards the dinner table
- Cut away to the dinner table
	- Declan had called to get everyone into the room.
	- There are like 100 people in this room.
	- Declan goes to the door, takes a Halberd off one of the sconces, and metal gates shut all around the banquet hall.
	- Declan checks with Finley that everyone has returned. Seems so.
	- "RIGHT! The Monarch has been murdered."

		- Declan notes that Marvin thinks the King was murdered violently. Marvin will be cleared of suspicion first.
		- Marvin says something confidential with Declan.
	- Haralamb succeeds in noticing a moment with a gap. He casts invisibility with subtle spell and slips out. It appears as though anyone accidentally looking at me blinks and I am just not there, not suspicious, like I was behind someone else now.
		- I slip out as Declan gets the first retinue out of the room to investigate the King.
	- They march down the hallway. Marvin, Key. etc. is a part of the group. Something that has not happened in 5 centuries in Auberin has happened and they have been here to witness it.

				- Key rebuts that WE are not associated.
				- Marv tries to say that's fine because they were around each other. Key still doesn't care, she thinks its suspicious.
				- Key reveals Marv trying to tell her to follow their lead.
				- Declan finally gets Key to say her and Marv were in the garden at the same time.
				- Key says they found her in the garden and told her the king is dead.
				- Marv says they said that because someone else screamed it and they were trying to get her back to the dining hall as they desired.

	- Mina has immediately gone to her parents. She is scared it's the Imps. They're back, this is what I've been training for.
		- Mina: Did you hear, is it what we thin it is?
		- Dad: Mina, be still girl, it is not our concern.
		- But what if it is ?
		- Then we will be ready!
		- I don't think we can be ready if we're here just sitting with everybody else
		- Do you propose we leave the room?
		- Shouldn't we be trying to prepare/ Go home?
		- Her dad raises his sleeve and she sees a familiar outline of brass. "We have all we need darling. If there is a threat here, we will neutralize it."
		- Mina suggests leaving to go look
		- Her dad says the most people are here. They are the best protection here.
		- Mina rolls a nat 1, she is taken by thoughts that this is what she has trained for and her hands have started to go numb. Adrenaline rush. She doesn't see anything.
	- Dahlia is next to Tulip. Tulip is saying how crazy this all is.

				- Marv gets it out of Finley that a knife was the murder weapon.
				- Key gets Finley, even though he's not supposed to, to tell them that the wound(?) doesn't look like knife and that it was probably a metal knife.
					- Marv thinks that's not what she's asking. Imagine the wooden knife was made of metal. Did the knife look like the wooden knife, if it was made of metal?
					- Finley reveals they haven't found it.
					- Finley is beet red, flushed and hollow. He exclaims that he has never been around for the murder of a monarch and calls Key's knife mishap a blunder. He apologizes for lashing out.
					- Marv tries to get Finley to calm down.
						- Marv gets Finley to take a look at their paper. It is supposed to have Declan's signature and imply that Key, Sioan, and M are under cover. He talked to them first and nobody knows about it.
						- Finley is not sure about it. He's gonna need to talk to Declan. He's not permitted to "behave on his own"
					- Minor detail: Key was carving the knives earlier with a piece of Penny that she could detach.
	- Cut back to Dahlia.
		- Geoffrey saddles up next to her. "First regicide to happen in your neck of the wood? I have seen about 6 or 7. I was blackout for one of them. There was poison in one but Geoffrey was built different. Constitution of a bull"
		- If Dahlia wants Geoffrey there, he will stick by her side all night. If people reject him he moves on, "fair enough"
			- He's like so where is this night headed?
		- "Geoffrey, this IS my first time I've seen a monarch die"
			- Thats crazy, youll have to come to Kallanda sometime
			- I'm going to have to talk with my family
			- I'll come with, meet them, get his blessing to do whatever we are going to do
			- He's kind of a "chill guy," a "chiller"

			- He kisses her dad's hand.
			- "The eminent edwin... alliteration... you see I'm very well schooled. Your daughter and I could see the world together"
				- Do you know. The monarch's jsut been murdered and this is highly inapproproate
				- Seh said you're a chill guy. Have you ever been to Kallanda?
				- Can't sayu I have, most people haven't been out of the Isles.
				- You could come see my family.... naybe we have a big family party.... polyamory is so normal in Kallanda.... you are a little old for me maybe but MY UNCLES they would eat you alive!!!
		- While this is happening, Dahlia takes Tulip aside to talk in relative secrecy.

			- Tulip gets loud and people shy away a little bit.
			- Tulip says she's a little attracted to Finley. He's scrawny in a way like she could beat him up. She also likes Mina but maybe she wants to beat up a twink with her as well.
			- Tulip found out that "Wilhemina is gorgeous"
				- Dahlia says like, isn't that obvious by looking at her?
				- She was really suspicious of them, like maybe the other families know they were sent there for reasons...
				- Dahlia thinks maybe she's just a suspicious type.
				- Tulip thinks it was targeted suspicion at their family, maybe not specifically either of them.
			- Dahlia says they have done not that much that night.
				- Tulip says "Yeah I killed the monarch, I jest I jest"
				- Nobody notices her sister's bad joke, thankfully
				- Dahlia thinks they don't have much to worry. She is a little more nervous around people and doesn't want Tulip to leave her side.
				- Tulip thinks Dalia wants to wingman her. Dalia is more worried about Tulip's safety.
				- Tulip mentions that if they are in danger Dalia can do "the thing with your glove where you take it off" and motions about
				- Dalia tells her to stop making such motions and tries to make sure she doesn't drink any more wine.
				- Dalia offers Tulip either a dagger or whip for protection. She chooses the dagger. Tulip says it will go down her sleeve and her sleeve wont be rolled up because its unladylike. Dalia tells her she will be number one suspect if she shows this.
				- Dalia hands over the knife and ties it to her arm with a ribbon so it doesn't go flying anywhere.
	- Cut back to her parents.
		- Geoffrey is describing something called a "Kallandan Double Decker". Dad is mortified, the mom is intrigued and considering it.

		- Tulip suggests walking around with a notepad and talking to people.
- Cut to the interrogation room.
	- M: So you don't know where the murder weapon is?
		- Declan is annoyed with Finley. He says Key is really convincing and got him caught up in words. M shakes their head.
		- Marv bemoans Finley being second in command. Declan says "Yeah." and suggests there are other options.
		- Key is annoyed everyone is calling her "The Key Girl"
			- Out of character: her mom is soooo dead
		- Marv asks if he can call her dad Sioan, she says Mr. Farrigan.
			- He tries to get him to agree Finley isn't fit for the post. He agrees
			- Finley tries to defend himself but gives up.
		- M keeps trying to get in as the second in command. They try to explain themselves and how they panicked and lashed out. They apologize. They try to assure him that Key had nothing to do with the King's death and that Mr. Farrigan has utmost respect for the monarch.
		- M is for some reason still trying to get Key to say again that they were both in the Garden when the ylearned the King's death.
	- Finley reveals that he saw Haralamb visit the kitchen when he wasn't supposed to
		- Everyone in the room is aghast, frozen at this reveal as Finely tries to explain that nobody knows who could be the suspect
		- M asks where the knife was stored... kitchen
			- They connect that Haralamb had visited the kitchen.
			- M offers their services once more for making this connection.
		- Declan apologizes now that they know her knife truly was stolen.
		- M proposes to Declan that he needs to find the Kallandan
			- I don't take orders from you but I agree
		- It is of great importance to find him. Second, having someone here with Finley so he doesn't overexpose would be helpful and I could do it.
			- Declan agress, noting M isn't above suspicion.
		- Sioan is exasperated and says that his daughter's name better be cleared.
			- Declan apologizes to Key and says he doesn't believe she did the murder. The fact that it may well have been her knife used, so he can't take her out of the book.
			- She says she doesn't suppose he wants one (of the wooden knives?)
				- Declan reassures her they're beautiful and asks if he can hold onto them for evidence. She agrees and he commends her craftsmanship
		- Declan dismisses Finley and tells him to go grab the Kallandan.
			- M tries to get him to let them get the Kallandan.
			- Declan says it will be pretty straightforward.
		- Finley guides the group back to the banquet hall. Declan and M will stay.
		- Key and Finley have an immature spat. Declan gets on his ass and demands order.
		- Key and Finley are friends now, but she thinks he hates her ass.
			- Key is so charmed by him. She feels like she was trying to be cute and biffed it.
			- Finley is flustered by her, and M picks up on it.
		- They move on, walked back to the banquet hall.
		- Declan speaks to M, asks that they're a journalist.
			- Aye
			- Are you usually this grating?
			- How do I say this... I'm a person of the people.
			- Right, how would I have guessed that
			- If I were to describe you, in an article... in theory a "bootlicker" might be a term I'd use, class traitor, but more importantly the king is dead right now. My gratingness comes from my dislike of the elites and those who support them. It's less personal. Declan, as I've gotten to know you this evening, you seem like someone who really cares.
			- Right
			- M is genuinely sad the king has passed because he knows the king treated his workers well.
			- Finley will bring the next batch of people; both of the Kallandans, etc.
			- M: when you bring in the next batch, I will sit here, bring out my pen and pad of notes, 
				- Declan thought the pen trick M did was so cool but its so vital he not show it. "Neat"
			- M: I won't but in like I usually do.
			- That would be appreciated, thank you.
		- Finley is a little lost. The quiet makes him nervous. He's acting like a tour guide.
- Cut to Mina
	- Her parents remain seated, politely continuing to eat dinner. Nobody else is.
		- Aura farming
	- She is torn between duty and "ugh my parents are crazy"
	- Dalia feels a tug around her waist as Tulip has wandered towards Mina
		- "You parents are just batshit crazy"
			- She and tulip talk more.
			- Mina has said something that made Tulip absolutely flustered with her in introductions.
			- She asks Tulip to come sit down, and pours her a glass of water.
			- Tulip asks Dalia to get her a garbage can.
				- Dalia gets it easily. Connor is sobbing by the trash can.
				- Dalia tries t ocomfort Connor and asks if he wants some company
				- He doesn't know, doesn't know if she killed his dad, doesn't know if he should talk to his mom or what. He can trust the trash can. please don't take it awayyyyy
				- Dalia offers to attach Connor to the garbage can like she attached Tulip to herself
				- "What if you have aknife or a whip....."
				- Mina signs to Dalia that they absolutely need that trash can.
				- Dalia finally convinces Connor as Key and the rest of the group reenter
				- Connor points out the "knife girl" and how it was "embarrassing for he and what if she killed my dad"
				- At last, Connor lets her tie him to the trash can with ribbon.
			- Finley appraoches, snaps fingers, and walks away.

				- "You were looking a little lost..." etc
				- She's a little out of her depth.
				- Dalia says she's learned that something people have liked tonight is being tied to someone they trust with a blue ribbon.
				- Dalia suggests Key give Finley a little piece of ribbon
					- She is offended. WHAT ABOUT FINLEY?
					- I'm not connected to FInley at all.
					- Well I am. He's Cool
					- Oh Okay
					- He's kind of cool and safe and you walked in with him and he did finger guns towards you
					- Key is confused what that was about and comments that he's not cool
					- Dalia says she should take the blue ribbon, "trust"
					- Key takes the blue ribbon and gives a piece of wound copper in exchanged.
					- Dalia says she'll hold onto it as a sign of friendship and tells her to go talk to Finley
					- If she's really nervous she can say Dalia sent her.
					- Dalia gives the go ahead, she's with Geoffrey right now.
	- Most people are quietly huddled against the wall. Geoffrey is loudly talking to Dalia's parents. Mina's parents are eating at the table.
		- Mina hears all of the conversation between Dalia and Key

			- Key says she wants to go into the kitchen
			- Mina asks why

					- Finley asks where he went
					- Mina says "arent you in charge"
					- Dalia makes a plan with Mina to get Finley to let them + Key go out to look for Haralamb

						- Dalia brings him to her parents to console him.
	- The girls ride out to go chat with Finley. He looks terrified as 4 women walk up to him
		- Key looks at him and asks that he mentioned Haralamb going into the kitchen after her.
			- "Yep"
			- I think we all need to go into the kitchen.
				- Mina stands behind her, intimidating. Dalia waves. Tulip tries to seduce him.
			- Key gives Finley a copper broach thing, and he thinks its gorgeous. She asks him to escort them to the kitchen.
			- Finley says he has to go tell Declan that they don't know where Haralamb is. He's had a couple misses tonight...
			- The group further tries to seduce him. They discuss among themselves that they need to lock in
			- Finley makes an idiom about boiling water making a potato soft but an egg warm and Mina asks if he's hard or soft.
			- Finley says he thinks he should tell Declan who will inform the rest of the royal guard and then maybe they will provide assistance.
			- Dalia asks if Finley can make them Royal Guard and Finley is shocked, asks her what pull they think he has
			- Mina suggests two birds one stone, he tells Declan and the ground goes to look for Haralamb in the kitchen in addition
			- Finley cautiously agrees, saying that Declan says Finley should take more initiative and stand up for himself.
			- Mina is also inducted into the Blue Ribbon Club after some discussion; Tulip flirts with her excessively
			- Key is still thinking Finley is weird about her but maybe he doesn't hate her.

			- Key's dad asks her where she's going and she tells him she thinks she's making friends
				- Tonight?
				- Well, when else am I going to do it?
				- Maybe not during a murder investigation sweetheart
				- I think I have a lead where my knife is. This is important to me and I'll see you later
				- I was about to say I trust you. Ill see you later. I believe in you
	- The group is in the hallways unescorted.
		- Dalia tells Tulip to play the quiet game.
- Cut back to Declan's office
	- M comments that Finley is taking a really long time and there is immediately a knock on the door
	- Finley opens and he has only brought Geoffrey, who is in really good spirits as always.
	- M: Great, where's the other one. Tall?
		- Haralamb? Nobody has seen him for hours. Well, no he was in the banquet hall for a little bit.
		- Finley tells Declan that they learned that Haralamb is not in the banquet hall and that he instructed the Blue Ribbon Club to go investigate the kitchen
		- Declan is mad at Finley. Nobody was supposed to enter or leave and goes off on him for being inept. Finley is close to tears.
		- M gets loud about how it wasn't point A to point B and Declan demands they calm down.
		- M asks Finley where the ladies are headed. He replies that they're going to the kitchen
		- M is incredulous at this idea of them going to the Kitchen Haralamb went to early.
		- Finley says yeah they're going to bring him back.
		- M thinks this idea is crazy that he thought they could bring him back.
		- Geoffrey tries to convince them that Haralamb is a nice guy who wouldn't do that.
			- "Would that guy be friends with a murderer? I mean shit maybe, but idk trust"
		- Declan says they got off on the right foot with M and that he's pissed and where they're at. Still mad as hell at Finley, jokingly(?) suggests capital punishment
		- M asks Declan who is in charge. He says right now it is him, unfortunately.
			- He's not the monarch but he has authority to detain anybody until they can figure out who's guilty until they can detain them and vote on which family will be the next monarchs
		- M says that if one of the families wanted to be the monarch, the place to start would be to start the voting process by... Finley?
		- Kill the monarch? Good yes
		- Finley boasts that he's a member of the Blue Ribbon Club. The ladies have taken him in
			- M: what like a dog?
		- M is incredulous that Finley was the best option here. His dad was in the military.
		- Declan took a chance on Finley, because he thought it would be a low stakes royal event. M asks if he couldnt move things around and Declan comments how he didn't quite have the time.
		- M asks if Sioan Farrigan went with the girls. No, he stayed in the banquet hall and trusted his daughter.
		- M asks about Mina's family. They're still in the hall eating dinner calmly. M is in awe. Declan finds it incredibly concerning.
			- I don't know what to tell ya, there's a lot of people acting strangely.
		- Finley mentioned Dalia and Tulip are part of the group of girls who went off to the kitchen.
			- Declan comments that they always cause troubles at this type of event
		- M comments that Mina, the Heilviegh girl, fought and gouged the eye out of another noble.
		- Finley says the boy just got too close  to her sword and M replies that he's about to get too close to his sword
		- Geoffrey tries to defend Haralamb again as a cool guy who definitely didn't do it.
		- M double checks they have the story right: Finley sent Mina, known hothead and violent towards a noble; Tulip and Dalia, known for causing constant troubles including tonight and Tulip is so drunk; and Key, who was just in the interrogation chamber having whittled knives, so go search alone.
		- M asks if Declan ran a followup weapon check; No that's what this was for.
		- M says they're going to find Sioan. They need to talk to Mina's family.
		- Finley says his friend Phineas and him run the barracks. Phineas could take over. Declan says to go get him.
		- Declan(? Finley?) is going to ring the bell and send messages. M needs to come with him.
		- M suggests not ringing the bell because it might cause more pandemonium.
		- Declan asks how else they'd inform the soldiers.
		- M suggests Finley's new job and punishment is to run all across the whole castle to every station and inform everyone the Blue Ribbon Brigade is on high alert.
		- Declan agrees.
- This all took about half an hour. Things are actively happening. I make an Arcana check; success one of three. I know what I'm doing.
- Cut to Blue Ribbon Brigade
	- They are in the hallway. They enter the kitchen, and it's empty.
		- Dalia asks who in the group is good with weapons. Mina and Tulip. Tulip lets known she has a dagger.
		- Mina grabs her arm in a romantic manner and asks her to give her the dagger.
		- Tulip refuses; it's a family dagger. She unsheathes it and shows it off.
		- Dalia tries to take it from her. Tulip keeps it.
		- Mia searches for a nice, sharp kitchen knife.
		- Key tries to detect magic on the cutlery.
			- Finds nothing.
		- Dalia tries to find a kitchen knife that looks the same.
			- Key helps
			- Nat 20, total 25
			- Dalia looks at the knife Mina has picked up. Many of the knives in the kitchen are very nice, but Mina picked up the kind that was used in the switch. Two of those knives are missing. In this moment, there's a third knife that has been taken from the kitchen; there's one that is unaccounted for. One was used in the cake, one is held by Mina, and there's another open spot.
			- The kitchen knives could do some damage if someone tried, per Tulip. Mina asks if she stabs alot, she says she likes to fight with knvies, Mina thinks its hot.
			- Mina suggests looking at the king's body; this knife might not have been able to reach someone's heart without bending but Key's knife possibly could. Her's is ceremonial; if used perfectly correctly it could be. So that's unlikely actually.
			- Nobody irl knows where this heart puncture idea came from
		- Mina is trying to detect Imp interference.
			- Mina hears something that sounds a little bit like a whisper; an echo of a whisper, something that was said earlier. "Pick it up"
	- The group head towards the King's chambers to investigate the body
		- Blue Ribbon Club makes an investigation check at the same time as M and Declan; whoever gets higher makes it to the king's bed first

			- M looks for any sign of the BRC being there.
			- M notices there are 3 knives missing from the kitchen.
			- They ask Declan what the cause of death was; he is not sure but there was a stab wound involved. The stab wound was shallow. It was a stab in the back, could not have gotten through the ribs.
			- M posits that Key's knife might be really good for killing being a "big fancy knife" but Declan comments that its for cake
			- M: Two separate things; if the knife we're thinking of was a cake knife that's not killing someone. One of these kitchen knives killing someone is unlikely. Was the wound significantly larger than one of these?
			- It was about this size.

		- I'm gonan need you to clear the room. I need to do an investigation, Declan was all over the place.
		- What? All over the place?
		- He seemd  a bit scatter brained
		- Right, well, I don't know if Declan would appreciate you tlaking like that.
		- No, he sent me here specifically to say! I don't think you're listening to what I'm saying. I'm gonna need you to clear the room.
		- Right chain of command,
		- Thank youuuu!!!!
		- you're going to watch over the body for Declan:

			- The guards will definitely walk past Declan on their way down
	- They investigate the body.
		- The king is face down on the bed.
		- Mina looks at the wound on his back and she doesn't think it was fatal. She thinks something might have been applied to the instrument. She notices darkening of veins around the cut. She has seen something like this before
		- The way the king's body is splayed, this looks like how he was laying originally.
		- They flip the body. The king's face has a pale foam at the mouth.
			- There is a specific kind of toxin referred to as Imp's blood, made from berries found in Bluebird Bayou(?). The Dawes family is from there.

	- M & D are walking down the hallway and see the soldiers pass by
		- Declan asks the soldiers why they aren't with the king.
			- Yeah, Finley told us you sent him up.
			- M: so whos with the king?
			- Finley.
			- M: We gotta go, you two come with us too
		- They start booking it towards the quarters.

- Cut to Haralamb
	- As he has made two chips in the henge at the top of the castle, he hears a knock on the door.
	- It is Amin, the newly-appointed governor.
	- They have a conversation. Amin says he is also under Beolacht's orders and suggests that maybe Haralamb won't get what we wants, that only one of their deals needs to be upheld, etc. Haralamb doesn't believe him and thinks his end of the bargain needs to be upheld.
	- Haralamba levels the blade at him and tries to make Minor Illusion cause a disorienting boom hit Amin. It fails, but a booming bubble of some sort expands from the point of the blade. The foundations of the castle rumble.
	- "Scary" says Amin
- The group in the King's quarters feel the rumbling. They look at muralsI(?) describing Beolacht being locked away and such.
	- They look at the King's diaries and see it get further towards mad scrawlings.
	- Maeve does not cease her housing ... and she does not know what I drink(?) I must do it to sleep
	- M jots things down in their journal and inspects the room further. They inspect the body

	- The group arrives on the heels of Declan at the precipice of the henge.
		- Haralamb is leveling the ceremonial knife at Amin
		- Mina is sick with Impish influence
		- I yell out to Declan that I am so happy he's here and that I have corner the murderer.
