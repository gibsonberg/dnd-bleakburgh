# Synopsis

[[Pony Harrigan]] and [[Fineas Penn]] enter the [[Great Cactus Forest]] in search of some mysterious artifact. Pony had previously hired Fineas in the town of [[Sundance]] to aid in the finding of this item. While making their way through the cactus brambles, they sense a creature stirring. With Fineas sensing that it's somehow magical in nature by the aid of the [[Left Hand of the Foreman]] in his pouch in his pouch in his pouch in his pouch in his pouch in his pouch in his pouch in his pouch, they give chase. Enter [[Slim Jim]], who also spots the creature and instinctively gives chase. Slim Jim and Fineas end up falling over as the creature reaches its owner, [[Lark]]. The creature turns out to have been a two-headed opossum-like pet named [[Lark#Mary and Shelly|Mary and Shelley]]. Lark passes out with exhaustion. Fineas and Pony decide to set up camp and get a full rest, while Slim Jim plays in the cacti. Time appears to have stopped in the dead of night. 

A light becomes apparent on the periphery. This light is clearly arcane, but its nature is unattainable. As any member of the group approaches it, it sinks back into the brambles in equal measure. As the ground almost seems to slip from under them the longer they sit still, the group decides to follow the light to a clearing. They enter the clearing and approach the light in the center, while Lark stays to the edge.

The light calls out to all of the members of the group within the clearing, showing them something important to them. Fineas hears the screams of his coworkers dying in the mines, while Pony hears his dead family telling him to step closer. Pony touches the orb and the brambles at the edge begin to close, forcing Lark within the clearing, where he sees the fire that once consumed him. Heads appear from the writhing cactus stalks and lash out at the group. It becomes obvious that they would not be able to defeat this [[Cactus Hydra]]. Pony decides to aim his arm at one of the heads furthest from the rest of the group and attempt to fire, self-immolating himself and the creature in the process. It is suddenly mid-day, and time appears to have started once again. Fineas realizes that the money he has so far been paid is counterfeit, and gets a weary Pony to replace it with actual gold pieces. Slim Jim heals Pony, and with that the group treks out of the Cactus Forest towards [[Greenfang]]. 

As the group enters Greenfang, they find it seemingly completely deserted. Every building old or new appears to have been boarded up and left to the ravages of time. The group sets up camp in one of the buildings, and decides to rest. During Fineas' watch, he notices an eye peering though a gap in the boards. As the eye is noticed, who or whatever it belonged to sprints away from the building.
