Campaign: [[Dungeons and Deserts]]
Setting: [[Darton]]

Previous Session: [[2025-07-12]]

# Synopsis

- We find ourselves in the vast, starless field past the Darton boundary.
	- We see a far-off island in the midst of nothing. A woman wrapped in vegetation, in pain, bearing the weight of the city on her shoulders.
- Pony pilots the train towards it.
	- He (nat 20) feels a shift in the motion of the train. As soon as it broke through & the heat shield dissipated, it's now relying mostly on inertia and the tracks are flickering.
		- He needs to crash land
	- The island out there is Darton, it's like the size of NYC.
	- Pony spots a courtyard that looks like it once held a marketplace.
		- The city appears to have warped somehow. It's being pulled into a point at the center vertically. The vegetation seems denser here.
		- The landing spot is about half a day's travel from the center.
		- "This is your captain speaking. Please take a seat, buckle your seatbelts, we're going to be having a bumpy landing."
			- Lark questions what a seatbelt is. Maisie feels oddly more at ease. This isn't a reference to anything because Pony has never flown.
		- The train comes in to land.
			- Pony finds the emergency break lever and the trains slows in the air. THey get a foot off the ground before it just falls and hits the courtyard.
		- We examine our surroundings.
			- I see that there's regular vegetation that grows here, but it is warped. Things narrow and balloon. There is mushroom fungal blooms in many spaces. A pair of fingers are peeking past some foliage, someone or something is looking at us.
			- Lark baits one of the randoms to step off the train first. Lark tells him to take a few steps forward and asks how he feels. He is confused.
			- Fineas walks towards where the figure was. He ducks around the corner.
				- I see a humanoid figure, twisted, blooming with fungus around the extremities, rot creeping in. This person doesn't have a mouth, but there are strange indents and cavities with teeth.
				- This thing is scared of me.
				- I approach it with some food from my bag. A hand, split in two, reaches out and grabs the food and eats it through a pocket in its skin and just looks up at me.
			- Lark looks around immediately off the train.
				- It seems like a lot of things are undisturbed for a very long time. Dust covers most surfaces. He sees some spots where splatters of blood have coated passageways.
			- Slim Jim observes his surroundings.
				- He notices he his much more scattered internally here. Many different sets of thoughts. Two distinct pitches of human voices bickering about where to go in his mind.
			- Fern observes her surroundings.
				- Being here feels intense. Constant, external pressure, like someone gripping her forearm.
		- Fineas is going to sit down.
			- The thing seems to recognize.
			- I call out to the group.
			- A few of them round the corner and comment on how ugly it is.
			- It seems to not be able to parse Common.
			- Lark tries talking slower to it. He tries ad hoc hand signs.
			- It looks around and darts off into the city.
				- Lark looks around for what it saw.
				- It scampers around the corner and Lark sees lots of little fingers and pairs (clusters) of eyes looking out.
		- Pony examines the blood. It's about a week and a half old. Pony also detects smashed vials and tubing.
		- Lark and Pony wave at the group of beings.
			- Fern gives one of them a pastry, which it takes readily.
		- Lark looks for an important building. All of them seem about the same.
			- He asks about important buildings or areas. He inquires about historically-important buildings.
			- Lark looks around at the state of ruin of the city and deduces that just about any amenities that once served a purpose is no longer fully intact.
			- The spire at the center, now that we're on the ground and closer to it, carries a stamen-like shape. It's like it's some sort of massive fungal growth.
		- We try to figure out if we should leave at the train and if so, who.
			- Arnold is coming with. Carlos is coming with.
			- Lark convinces Arnold to guard the train because he's hit about 2 shots total.
			- Alistair is watching the train. He starts chatting up Arnold about theater.
			- There's further discussion on if we even should be leaving them.
			- Pony investigates the train with Lark's assistance. The train isn't starting right now. That's all he can tell.
			- We deduce it's probably not safer to leave them behind. Two randoms stay with the train. Everybody else joins us.
		- The group starts walking through the city.
			- We see that wherever we go, the little fingers and eyes watching us are ever-presenter.
				- Fern and Jim give insight.
					- Slim Jim is too distracted. The voices are sounding more distinct. His thoughts are not entirely his own.
					- Fern looks at the things and notices how there are little bits of cloth wrapped up in some of their folds. These must have been the original inhabitants of Darton. They have been here for hundreds of years.
			- We continue wandering.
				- Fern continues taking notes to bring back to Cheryl and Jonas.
				- The point in the center of the city occasionally thrums. We feel a vibrations through the city.
					- Fineas notices the LHotF is maybe even less reactive than it usually is. No clue why. So much going on? Not picking up on anything.
			- We are pushing towards the center.
				- Lark asks Maisie if the Cardinal said about where he was going to go once he got to Darton.
					- All he made her aware of is that there's something at the center of Darton, something beneath Darton.
				- We are not sure of the life cycle here, but things seem to meld into the environment. Skulls and skeletons look like, where they have decayed, they have sprouted and grown in new directions. Vertebrae spiderweb out, etc.
				- Group insight check.
					- Fineas feels a lurch in his stomach. It doesn't feel significant, but he can't shake the feeling that one of his organs has moved.
					- Lark notices a twitching muscle, incessant. His disks have been inactive.
					- Fern notices a hamstring cramp.
				- It's weirdly quiet, almost peaceful. There's a stillness to the air. It feels as though we are the only group of living things for many miles.
				- As we approach the center, towards the spire, we feel the draw of the anti-life energy. We feel more tired.
					- We have Ronald, one of the randos, walk in front.
				- The path begins to wind up and out away from the chitinous, lattice-covered buildings. It looks almost like ash has fallen and grown in formations.
				- The growth of the fungal bloom is almost like a mountain with tunnels.
- We enter one very large tunnel.
	- There's some mild bioluminescence. The tower thums every so often.
	- We approach what we think must be the center.
		- Ronald goes. "Oh, I think there's someone up here"
			- He waves and he gets evaporated by a green bolt.
			- Al is upset at seeing someone blow up.
		- There is a rumbling as a voice says "Hello." It's not familiar in any capacity.
		- "Approach"
		- The pathway behind us begins to close behind us.
			- We hesitate and make dexterity savings throws.
				- We are all below the threshold. We all take damage. As the fungus hits us, it feels like it tries to take root. The fungus burns away but the wound is larger than it seems like it should be.
	- We arrive upon a scene. We see what appears to be the Cardinal with his back facing us in a strange, luminescent, spheroid cavern. The walls breathe and hum around us. One of the thrums happen. It is the most intense it has ever been here. The Cardinal isn't looking at us.
		- Lark: "Yeah I'm gonna kill this guy now" he takes aim and fires at him
			- It lands middle of the back. No reaction. There is a deep rumble. It sounds a little bit like a laugh.
		- Fineas observes the Cardinal.
			- He's not facing us. Fineas notices his heels and the balls of his feet are just half a centimeters off the ground. There's a pulsing outline on the other side of him.
			- Fineas steps to the side to get a better look. There is a congregated vein of fungal tissue. It connects to his chest and spreads through his arms and to his extremeties. His head alone turns to face me. Mouth doesn't open. He says "I'm so glad your sister is here to see this"
		- We enter initiative.
			- Pony notices, wrapped and tangled up in the walls, are the bodies of many Cathars. Canisters are crushed, pods are broken and spilled on the ground. Everything is open and stable but it seems like the earth below us is malleable.
				- Pony casts Lightning Bolt. He moves to the front so he won't hit anyone else. The Cardinal fails his DEX save. The Cardinal is hit directly and the cavern reacts. Nodes pulse inwards from the ceiling and retract. He burns a legendary resistance and takes half.
				- Cardinal uses a Legendary Action.
					- He targets Pony with an attack. Natural 1. A pillar of fungal bloom strikes inches from Pony.
			- Lark's turn. Insightful fighting(?) he gets sneak attack against Cardinal no matter what. He shoots at the Cardinal. He deals some damage.
				- The Cardinal makes an attack towards Lark. Another pillar slams towards Lark and misses.
				- The Cardinal aims for an area that hits everyone in our group.
					- Anyone who didn't get a nat 20 (so basically just Fineas and Carlos) has to deal with difficult terrain = half speed.
			- Arnold's turn.
				- "Arnolds gonna do the dang thing."
				- He shoots at the Cardinal twice. He action surges and shoots more. He hits all 4 times.
				- He hits with Violent Shot twice.

			- Alistair's turn.
				- He give's a die of inspiration to Arnold.
			- Fineas' turn.
				- He dashes towards the Cardinal, exiting the range of the difficult terrain. He throws two Javelins at the Cardinal, hitting once. Guardians are sicced on the Cardinal. (I think I accidentally used two actions here. Sam has okayed it.)
			- Slim Jim's turn.
				- He runs towards the Cardinal. He hits him with a spell attack (Guiding Bolt?).
				- The Cardinal causes some tubes to converge towards him(?). The hum and throb. A screech comes from below, shaking the earth beneath us. He heals for 43 points.

			- Lark
				- Moves forward, steady aims. Nat 20, plus sneak attack. Hits the Cardinal for 47, halved to 23.
				- He aims and feels the disks buzz as he shoots the Cardinal. A blue trail follows the bullet as he hits.
				- Cardinal aims two attacks. Both hit. Down to 1 hp.
			- Cardinals turn
				- Takes moon beam damage. Cardinal fails CON save but burns leg  resistance to take half but then it is doubled. 14 radiant dmg.

			- Arnold makes a death save. Passes, nat 20?
			- AListair makes a death save. Passes?

				- Makes goober spit? Casts 5th levelmoon beam on Cardinal, he takes 20 radiant dmg.
				- End of Fern's turn, the part of the floor between the martials & the spellcasters starts to open. Slim Jim and Fineas see a channel opening up down to the nape of the neck of the woman below, tendrils reaching up. The canopy above begins to open up. The Cardinal taps into some root from her and a bolt of green energy rushes forward towards him and he takes two legendary actions towards Fern
					- Hits twice with an attack, dealing 16 dmg. Two concentration saves. Passes both.
			- Maisie's turn.
				- She snaps out of being stunned. She routes around the hole in the ground, stands right  at the precipice. She reaches out and hits Fineas with lvl 4 Healing Word.
				- She casts Bless on the 6 nearest people. Whenever we make an attack or save, add d4 while concentration.
				- Layer action at end of her turn. Hole opens up beneath her. Maisie begins to fall.
				- As the caverns open up further, we see the sky opening up above start to look a little more like regular Bleakburgh
					- Lark and Jim make nat 20's. Lark looks up.
						- Lark has learned a lot about the Down. This is just like the Down but super mode. He looks up and he sees Bleakburgh. The terrain of his homeland appear above them. The Cardinal is trying to bring this nexus into Bleakburgh, trying to cause an overlay between the Void and Material Realm.
							- "Big Giant lady is about to come out of the spire and into Bleakburgh"
						- Jim is at the precipice. He watches the woman below, bloodshot fungus-filled pupil looks up at Jim. He knows he is looking at Eve in shackles.
			- Carlos' death save. Passes.
			- Pony's turn.
				- backs away from the holes
				- Casts Vortex Warp on Maisie. He has to make a persuasion check to shout something at Maisie.
					- She isn't convinced. She makes the saving throw.
					- She fails the CON save. "NO!"
					- She gets yanked out to relative safety. She lands on her back and has the breath knocked out of her.
			- Lark's turn
				- Approaches further.
				- Steady aim. Throws disk at Cardinal. Hits due to Bless.
					- Saving throw. Cardinal makes it. The disk starts to hover towards him but a fungal mass reaches out and destroys the disk.
				- At the end of his turn, the room starts to hum as we watch the bodies start to twitch and peel themselves out of the wall. 4 of them are released.
					- They are deformed. Parts of their skin and bone slough off. Something pooled inside of the drips out and burns the ground.
			- Cardinal's turn.
				- Moon beam damage. 32 radiant damage.
					- As moon beam hits, the things crawling out of the walls, openings getting wider and wider.
					- It kills the Cardinal.
					- Fern reaches out. There is a flash of blinding light and the stem connecting the Cardinal to the nexus snaps and the Cardinal falls backwards, surprised. The things keeping him alive are suddenly removed. Blood spills out of his mouth. He falls backwards. The Spire begins to crumble.
- The Spire begins to crumble.
	- Insight checks.
		- Fineas gets nat 20.
			- In this moment, as the node burns away, Fineas feels a warmth that Fineas has not felt in years. He feels something start to loosen in his chest. The connection to the fungal network is dying. We had been sent by this thing thatthat saw something beneath Darton, but it was itself a sort of sickness. It knew that it existed but tjat it could not exist in this relationship with the world. This dimension, whatever this is, is going to fall apart all around us. Everything that Darton is. It's ggravitating towards the decaying goddess. Fineas knows we don't currently have a way back.
		- Lark gets 26.
			- Lark's disks and such gravitate towards Slim Jim. The hole in the floor is widening. Lark shouts to grab Slim Jim.
		- Jim gets a nat 1.
			- Jim feels the dissonance become intense enough that the consciousness of Slim Jim knows that, in this space, he is aware of his 3 distinct parts: the void, the owners, the housecat. He feels the split happening. He knows he is not one cohesive being.
			- Jim tries to draw on the void.
				- Jim thinks he might have a choice here. He starts to fall into the growing hole. If he leans into the void, he might be letting something else go.
					- Jim feels like leaning into the void is the only way to get everybody out safely.
					- We fall towards Jim as this opens up. Jim begins to glow.
		- Fern begins to hear the whispers of Eve's voice on the edge of something.
			- She knows she is The Hearth, Slim Jim is The Familiar who is letting go of something connected to the mortal realm. She recognizes that she can provide a safe place for that to go. Jim is on the precipice of oblivion, but  she could catch some of that essence. She does.
		- Jim is falling further towards the Goddess.
			- Some of the group try to grab the downed members to help save them. Pony goes for Arnold, but fails.
			- Fineas maneuvers himself with Athletics. Fineas snags Arnold by a leather strap to bring him into a bear hug.
			- Carlos is gets Vortex Warped in around Jim
			- Pony Cures Wounds on Arnold to bring him back to consciousness.
			- Lark gets Snake Oil on Alistair's face, pours it down his throat, the liquid pours up as they fall.
- Slim Jim reaches a paw out towards Eve as he falls. A bright light emerges and a tunnel opens. It closes. Everybody is returned to Bleakburgh, in Darton, returned. It looks the way it did 200 years ago, fungus-less. The buildings look disrepaired still, but people once twisted get up, fine. People get up. Slim Jim is gone.
	- Insight check
		- Fern gets nat 20
			- Saw Jim make that dive. Wherever he his, he has made a decision not to come back so that everyone else could return.
		- Lark gets a nat 20
			- a
		- Pony looks around for Jim.
			- Pony is familiar with sacrifice enough to understand a friend has done something with him.
		- Fineas is busy holding Maisie, consoling.
	- Slim Jim opens his eyes. A gentle light streams through a nearby window pane.
		- A very tired woman sits at the head of a table and beckons for him. She scratches his head. "Welcome home."
		- Fern hears a little whisper of "Thank you."
		- Slim Jim hears Lark missing him, wailing for him. He leaves a message for Lark:
			- "Thank you for being my best friend. Name Darton after me"
	- Lark is calmed. He's sad but no longer ragin.
	- Maisie comes too. She for the first time feels like she has some idea of the world she was a part of and she holds onto Fineas and cries that she's sorry.
	- Lark and Pony understand that something in Bleakburgh, and maybe the world, has been restored. Pony doesn't know exactly what that means, but it helps that those people are no longer in pain.
	- Lark collapses into Pony's arms.
- Bleakburgh has been through a violent catharsis: lost cities, foreign invasions.
	- Something about the way Bleakburgh has been has now been restored.
	- What do our characters do?
		- We all cry for a while, rest, repair.
		- Lark gets a wisp for a disk.
		- Pony gets the sense that some but not all of the time loops have been fixed.
		- Pony, Lark go back to his house to see if his parents have been restored.
			- The loop is still going. Lark times it, waits until the morning before the fire started. Before it starts, he reaches his disk out and the strand goes and shimmers for a second, shaking. Nothing really seems to change. This time, Lark is able to go fully in. His mom and sisters are seated at breakfast. He cries to get their attention, but they don't notice him.
			- He thinks he can take a little more time and it will just work. He waits and waits and follows them about their day. He tries to get their attention. Eventually the fire starts. He tries to do everything in his power to bring them out, but it doesn't work. What was stopping Lark from fully entering the house before is now just around the people and the things.
			- It gets the the point of danger and Pony and Arnold drag Lark out of the house. He doesn't understand, he doesn't understand, he doesn't understand. He weeps. They go to bed. When they wake up in the morning, the house is no longer there. It's ashes.
			- Lark runs back in. He cries. He's kind of smiling. "They're not back but they're not hurting anymore. THey aren't burning everyday. It's better, okay?"
			- He asks Pony and Arnold to help him dig proper graves. They rest a hand on his shoulders and they do
			- He stays with Arnold and Pony for a little bit afterwards.
			- He then returns to Darton to fulfill his promise. With or without our help, he starts a major campaign to become the mayor of Darton as the Son of Eve to get in charge.
		- Fern feels her connection to Eve has strengthened again, it feels more like a conversation like in the old days.
			- She can see Slim. In some dreams she can sometimes come to the House.
			- Fern talks to Cheryl and Jonas about her findings in the Darton.
				- "Well yeah we sort of saw! Darton's back, hello?"
				- "Did the schematics help?"
				- She lies about using the video camera.
				- Nobody really saw much more than a bunch of explosions and a streak of light, nobody really knows what happened with the navy.
					- Neighboring nations like Arulon start to build no-fly markers around Bleakburgh
			- Fern tries to help acclimate people to the world, help out with feeding and helping them and telling them stories. She does not support Lark's campaign, but she says he has it "for sure". She tells people not to vote for the child.
			- Lark's campaign is full guilt-trip propaganda. They mostly remember "the bald guy"
			- Fern tries to come to an agreement with Lark to not lead but she will rename it. Lark says he'll appoint her the Secretary of the Treasury, gives other roles to other members of the party.
	- Fineas turns to Maisie for the first time and asks her what she'd want to do.
		- She says she wants to actually help people. She meets Deborah in Bastle again.
			- They unpack things, Deborah shows her how it is to be a healer and tend to her flock.
		- We return to Sundance to see if we can help rebuild.
			- We see someone with a straw stetson -- it's about living through a bombinb.
			- It's mostly refugees now, but we got post from Pony
	- In a year, we have all returned to Darton for Lark's town meeting.
		- Lark:
			- "Friends, family, countrymen, fellow explorers, and most of all, my fellow Dartonians.
			- I, Lark Harrigan, am placing my bid for Mayor and Ruler of our fair city."
				- People clamor at Mayor but are confused about Ruler
				- Arnold is also now Arnold Harrigan
				- Fern's canon last name is Fernifer
					- Furn Furneifer?
			- "I know what you are thinking; I may be young, but I am experienced beyond what you may think.
			- But I lead the party that freed Darton."
				- he names us
			- "I lead us into the bowels of Darton with my navigational expertise and Pony's technical prowess. We build a train, which flew into Darton. We climbed the highest spire.
			- Some of us were taken aback by your prior forms but I was not, I saw you for the people you are underneath.
			- We took this city back to help you people," etc. etc.
			- He offers an all in favor for voting him as mayor
				- Someone questions when polls are, some hands raise.
				- They start chanting "Son of Eve"
			- "With this power, I appoint Arnold Harrigan Sec of Defense, Furn Sec. of Education (and she will be building our first school), Pony Harrigan Sec. of Science.
			- We will be building a train station out of Darton.
			- Fineas Penn will be returning to Sundance."
				- Fineas suggests we get a terminal one day
			- Lark is taking petitions for other government positions.
			- "Darton was an evil place for a long time, and did a lot of bad things to a lot of good people. As we move forward, I would like to leave Darton behind.
			- From this day hence, our fair city is named after my best friend, the greatest man I ever knew, the greatest cat I ever knew, and the greatest god I ever knew,
			- The one who gave their life, nay, their existence, to save us all. From this day hence, our town is named Slim Jim"
				- "Yaaay... we'll workshop it"
				- "Two rows for the cat!"
					- Drinks pour
					- Statues of cats are built throughout the city.
- We close out.
	- A very large kitchen window, a little black and white dappled cat, watching everything below.
