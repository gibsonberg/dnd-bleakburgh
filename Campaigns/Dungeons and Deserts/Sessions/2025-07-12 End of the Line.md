# Synopsis

- **Recap:** We met in the Great Cactus Forest. The artifact was animating the Hydra. Pony was seeking an artifact to bring back his lost family. Lark was there for a similar reason with Mary & Shelley. Jim was just there. We traveled to Greenfang and saw the Cow Creature and the town's harvesting efforts. Arnold and Pony hit it off. Upon fleeing towards Beatstone, we fought snakes and arrived in Beatstone to find it almost entirely abandoned. Outposts outside the town had been built by the Cathars to study the effects of the funugs; notably their regenerative abilities. In an attempt to kill our party, the Greenfang patrol got into a scrap with the Cathars and were decimated. Arnold finds the Party. We headed to Sundance to find civilization, stole books from the last bastion of writing in the country. We beheaded the sheriff and scrammed real quick. We returned to Lark's home committed a war crime to the guards who followed us and explored the gorge, finding Friedrich. We found the Time Yarn and learned of Lark's abilities to manipulate time / time loops with his disks. We discovered the stone cat built by the Tokwa to judge the souls of those passing through the temple. We passed through unscathed; Pony becoming sober, Jim learned their connection to the divine, Fineas' memory of his sister was restored, Lark was confronted with his actions, and Friedrich (unable to face what he saw) called in a zeppelin which bombarded Sundanced. Lark breaks for a bit and has to regain trust. We headed to Silverton to discover the Cathars' main outpost and discovered Fern. We met up with the resistance and the authors and learned of Fern's magic. In the tunnels under Silverton, we found Bill McGraw's sigil forge (which he used to biuld his automatons in his original assault on Bleakburgh) which the Cathars were using to harvest life force or whatever. We met Alistair feigning as The Chrono Kid. After freeing prisoners, we get more information and stuff from the authors and head to Bastle. We encounter some cultists and got them to walk to Darton. Bastle is taken over by the Raving Razors. Pony and Arnold had a moment where they shared thoughts about their relationship for the first time this campaign. Lark teaches kid to fight and becomes known to them as the Chrono Kid. Maisie had been updating the Cardinal of our whereabouts and 
- We have gathered what we needed from the town.
- We send Alistair out to canvass and get people to help with us in Darton. Everyone helps Alistair out in some way with magic, flash of genius, etc. Fineas help be intimidating to help.
	- We roll a total of a 29. We get 20 people who want to join.
	- Alistair is basically able to convinced people with just telling them we don't want things to suck anymore.
	- I give Pony the gun I took as trophy and he preps it with a scope and gives it to Arnold.
	- Arnold calls it "Pony" but says maybe that's weird, calls it "Churchkiller" while in the church.
- A kid buys Lark a soda. The kid wants to join us in fighting the Cathars. The church killed his parents so he wants revenge. He has a slingshot.
	- Lark allows it after learning his parents died... "no one will miss you," the kid likes it.
	- The kid swipes a pistol off the syndicate.
	- The kid's name is Carlos.
	- Lark encourages poor gun safety and when the kid is into it suggest he join the cops.
- We spent some hours and material components to mend our horse-drawn carriage.
	- It's NOT enough to take all of us. We are mostly walking to Darton.
	- Pony gives Carlos one of the books we stole; it's a sequel to the Golden Saddle. Lark is enthused, but lightly annoyed with Al for not telling him it exists.
- We set out. We make a survival check. We use shade well and watch in a staggered formation.
	- Pony makes a compass to help him. In Bleakburgh, they just simply don't work. It spins in circles.
	- As we go nearer to Darton, the sun sets way earlier than expected (it is siummer in Bleakburgh), and the sky shifts redder than usual. The clouds are tinged in red.
	- We make Nature or Survival checks
		- The brush, deciduous trees, and yucca plants around us are bending such that they are almost horizontal. Fern and Lark notice that they're pointing in the same direction; towards Darton.
		- Lark holds his direction away from the direction the plants go and feels a pull towards Darton. He relays this information
	- We do a self-Insight check
		- Only Pony gets above 20 with a flash of genius; he can tell he's getting tired faster as he walks closer and closer to Darton.
		- Pony sees if Arnold notices; Arnold just kind of goes along with it, he hasn't noticed.
	- We keep walking. It reaches night. We set up camp.
		- As we set up, Lark is the only person who notices something.
			- Lark has spent his entire childhood navigating by stars. He notices that there are far fewer stars in the sky than usual.
			- "Pony, some of the stars didn't come back"
				- Pony investigates the sky. He sees that, in the constellations that are there, there are entire constellations missing from the sky. The are just actually not visible, not obscured or anything like that.
				- Pony can connect the dots a bit. Something is happening.
				- Pony notes which constellations are missing to see if they change over time.
	- We set down for camp for the night.
		- Pony makes mojitos for the group.
		- He lets Carlos have one. Lark drinks water.
		- Nobody calls Pony Pony, they call him Mojito Man.
		- Fern surveys the group. The highest level of any of these people is 3. She checks how willing they are to die for the cause.
			- Half of the group go home.
		- I confide in Pony about my dream. The red sky and the machines.
			- Pony asks if the machines are the Cathars', I don't think so.
			- I know that some of the landmarks in my dream remind me of the Darton skyline 300 years ago in textbooks.
			- It's probably not the current state of things but I'm worried.
		- Fern (on a natural 20) convinces everyone leaving to leave something of their goods.
			- They all leave 20gp worth of raw materials between them.
	- We head to sleep.
		- Slim Jim stirs in his sleep.
			- He opens his eyes. He sees something standing before him, not quite sure. The light is so vaguely dim that he can just barely see the contour of something in the distance.
			- He moves towards it. He feels like he's walking on desert ground, but he can't see it beneath him.
			- As he gets closer, there is a dim, pulsating green light. He gets closer and closer.
			- I have to roll a charisma saving throw. Fern does as well. We fail.
			- Fern and Fineas are both in the dream, looking at this thing.
			- We all see in the center what looks like a massive, sedentary, decaying woman. Her limbs are outstretched. She can't move. She's not fully aware of us.
			- The pulsing looks kind of like roots running through her body.
				- Mycelium? Not quite plant-like
			- Her eyes open just a little and Fineas and Fern sees Jim's head tilt back, mouth open, and light pours out from his mouth.
			- We all wake up.
- It's morning.
	- Fineas is visibly agitated by a second night in a row with odd dreams like this. He paces.
	- Wisdom saving throw for people in the dream.
		- Fern is the only person who's not sure if she saw us in the dream. Fineas and Jim know we were all there.
	- Fern mentions the dream in front of Carlos and Pony and they imply it was a sexual dream.
	- I notice that Maisie leans forward when we talk about the dream. I'm kind of indifferent to that
	- Jim mentions how it felt like the inside of him was burning.
	- Jim thinks about whether the woman was Eve.
		- Insight check with advantage. Dirty 20.
		- He has never seen a likeness of Eve, but he feels like his connection to Eve is what made that happen.
		- Fineas mentions the roots crawling about her, how he thinks its mycelium. He can't really be sure. It's really just an assumption.
	- Fern considers her connection to Eve. She gets the sense that the conceptions she dreamt about in the church and such are similar to the major arcana in tarot. The mother and the Familiar are hear. She doesn't know what the hearth is. She feels her connection to Eve is fainter.
- We begin to leave for our second day towards Darton. The 10 people get up and leave. 
	- As Jose discusses their departure and hands off items, Pony makes a noise rock that says 'Pussy' over and over and tries to leave it in his bag. He notices immediately and drops it.
	- Without checks of any sort, we can see that the roots of the yucca are starting to grow in errattic patterns; space distorts more and more as we approach Darton further.
	- A gecko scitters past; it has eyes on its back.
		- Lark goes to pick it up
		- He snatches the tail and it falls off immediately.
		- Pony feels that the mutation is similar to Mary & Shelley's. More frequent.
	- The light is mainly red, but the brightness of the light alternates. The clouds stay still in the air.
	- Self insight check:
		- Lark and Fern(?) can tell that if they don't stay on top of making sure people are cared for carefully, exhaustion is much more likely. The group survival checks are to see if the entire group takes a level of exhaustion.
		- Lark considers that Flash of Genius can apply to survival rolls for this purpose. Guidance will not.
		- Lark relays to the group that traveling slower is going to making things easier.
		- We will slow up and take an additional day to reach Darton.
	- We reach the end of the day.
		- Kendra checks group morale. The people we've had help us are increasingly unsettled but recognize it's too late to turn back.
		- Lark tells Al to perform a comedy to try to increase morale.
			- He decides to do Reigns of Fire because it really pivoted into comedic relief compared to Golden Saddle
			- It's an incredible performance. He has mastered his acting abilities.
			- As one man, he does this exerptly. The end goes "I'd ride anywhere with you, as long as you hold on to these my Reigns of Fire" and the crowd goes ballistic
		- Fern makees treats for us. We can eat them in the morning for 3 temp HP.
			- We should probably hold on to them, we get 1 per day.
		- Fern makes a religion check. She feels emboldened by the sense of community in the party. She is able to simply double the recipe to do 6 treats per day.
	- We go to sleep.
		- Slim Jim wakes up in the same space again tonight. She is alone.
		- Fern does not find herself in the dream space.
		- Fineas rolls an 18 on a Wisdom check?
		- Jim is standing directly under Slim Jim and she looms, hundred of feet tall. Her face is the size of Bastle. Tendrils and things are growing out of her nose, her irises are rolled back into her head. He can feel the rhythm of something ragged as though it were her breathing.
		- Jim says "Eve, what happened?"
			- Jim desperately tries to heal her.
			- Jim tries 30 points of Lay on Hands on Eve
		- Fineas watches all of this happen as though through 2-way glass.
			- I see strange nodules and such all over her body.
			- It looks so similar to the mushroom I encounted in Beatstone.
			- I try to pound on the "glass"
				- Strength check followed by straight Wisdom -- 24 followed by 18
		- As he lays his hands on the woman, a boom echoes through the space and she hears Fineas' voice as he pleads with him not to touch the mushroom nodules.
			- The spores start to pulse with increasing rhythm.
			- Instead of the ragged breath, he gasps. Her eyes open.
			- A burning sensation is felt in Jim's chest. It transfers directly to her and one of the spore nodules disintegrates.
			- Fineas watched the being get affected by Jim, but all he knows is that it's significant, not whether that was good or bad.
- Everybody wakes up. Jim has 30 fewer hit points.
	- Jim feels as though he did something incredibly significant, as though he solved something.
	- Same dim, red sky.
	- Carlos starts freaking out and Lark offers him a mojito to calm him down. Pony takes it from him.
	- We venture forth. Jim restores about half of his hit points.
	- We pass the survival check again.
		- Lark can tell that the effect has increased; now 2 levels of exhaustion.
	- We make it through the day without incident.
	- As we travel further, what few starts were visible at night are now visible in the dim red daylight sky.
		- Lark comments that he said that the stars were always there.
	- Lark decides to do camp games for morale.
		- Carlos in particular is really into the game. (Lark hits a nat 20)
			- Obo shinatin tatin?
		- Lark checks morale and finds that morale is pretty good right now.
	- It is the next night.
		- Everyone passes the night without dreaming. Fineas is slightly releived.
- The next morning. The sky has darkened to a deep dark red. The clouds are gone. The stars the remain are pin pricks. Both the moon and the sun are abovehead.
	- We march on. People's faces looks more sallow, gaunt.
	- People aren't just getting hungrier faster, it seems like their metabolism is going faster.
	- Lark considers if it seems like time is running faster like at the Time Yarn, and is able to tell it's not that; they're just running out of nutrients
	- Lark goes to talk to Maisie about the happenings in the anti-life zone.
		- She has been in better spirits.
		- "Yes, Lark..."
			- He begins to apologize about destroying the pendant.
			- Her knee-jerk reaction is to be pissed at him but there's some guilt.
		- Lark talks about how her and the Cardinal were planning something, so he figures she might know. He asks if she knows anything about why the sky changed color (gray, he's colorblind) and the faster hunger.
			- Lark notices her brow furrow. The mention of the pendant threw her for a loop slightly.
			- Lark notices her start to think aloud about how the Cardinal hasn't talked about the full plan; something under Darton was going to help them "find Eve" and bring her to them
				- Lark is distraught at hearing it's *under* Darton. Fineas does not hear this (thankfully).
			- She mentions that he said that the only way to make it into Darton was to have "Eve's everlasting light". (Eve's eternal life?)
			- She says it sounds like the Cathars were looking for some sort of "Shield of Faith" -- he doesn't answer many questions but she believed in him.
	- Lark hits Maisie with a "down low, too slow"
		- Maisie backhands Lark across the face instantly and he takes one point of damage.
		- "Was I?"
	- Lark talks to Arnold
		- He mentions how they'll have to do to "the down" because theres a "machine" under there that can help him be immortal -- Maisie told him.
		- Arnold tells Pony about this.
	- Pony goes to talk to Maisie
		- "Hey... so uh... I heard there's an immortality machine under Darton"
			- Uhhh.... no.
			- She told him some stuff but none of it was that.
		- Maisie conveys the actual information.
		- Pony redistributes the correct information.
			- The Cardinal was looking for some way to get past the anti-life shell. His hypothesis was that if there was a way to extend one's life past a reasonable end, someone could make it through and revivify him or something like that.
			- Pony recalls the experiments in Beatstone to use the fungus to extend people's lives.
			- Separately, there is something under Darton.
		- Pony relays this all to the group. Fineas is on edge with the fungal dreams and the mention of something being under Darton but can't be sure of anything.
	- We settle down for the 4th night.
		- Lark looks about for corpses of the cult. He notices clusters of footprints, assumed to be the cult we sent this way. He gets the sense that they've had the time to reach Darton.
		- Al does magic tricks for morale this night. Lark attaches a disk to his chest to try to prevent him from doing actual magic.
			- Jim assists with Prestidigitation fireworks
			- Incredible performance. "Maybe the best 4 nights of any of our lives"
			- He never gets shocked by the disk once.
			- Pony respects him a lot more after this.
			- Lark recalls his disk.
		- Fern is able to another 6 treats.
	- We go to sleep.
		- Jim has another dream. Scary music irl.
			- Jim sees the woman again in this dream, still sleeping.
				- On a nat 1, Jim doesn't have a CLUE what's happening
			- Fern rolls a charisma check, nat 1.
			- Fineas rolls a wisdom check, 6.
			- Fineas and Fern are asleep.
			- Where Jim laid hands on the woman in the previous dream, the woman looks slightly healed and relieved.
			- Jim starts to climb the woman.
				- He can't quite the specific textures. 
				- He notices that whenever he's near the nodules he starts to feel sick.
				- Jim investigates the nodules. They did not grow there naturally.
					- Jim knows already that they're fungus. They look placed there.
				- Jim cannot tell if there's a main one.
				- He moves near her heart and tries to use Lay on Hands on those ones while he's on her.
					- Jim uses 10 LOH and wakes up with 20 hit points missing.
					- The location clearly has a more profound effect.
			- The woman stirs from her sleep and Jim's consciousness in the dream fades.
- We wake up again.
	- Pony makes 3 Molotov cocktails
	- The earth is rumbling. Jim is the only one who knows why.
		- "Ohhhhh, okay" - Jim
		- Lark asks if this is supposed to happen. 'Yeah, uh huh'
	- Survival check
		- Nat 20 from Pony
		- We are able to make it to Darton in half the day.
	- We approach Darton.
		- Jim heals himself with Lay on Hands
		- A massive heat shimmer miles across in the outline of a dome appears across our view. Empty desert is within the dome.
		- Around the perimeter, along the edge (not through it), is a series of splattered blood stains like a body exploded.
		- I chuck a rock through the dome and the second it passes through, I don't see it anymore.
		- Pony looks at the blood stains. He can't be sure, but in the distance, there's something that's been there for a while.
			- He has looked at diagrams and part of him thinks it's a train.
		- Pony and the gang discuss putting his hand through the zone.
			- He recalls the authors talking about how a camera went through the zone and came back out melted.
			- It appears that it may affect inanimate things, but it only completely destroys life.
		- Lark throws a rock with a rope attached through, and pulls it back out.
			- It comes out changed. It has geometric patterns across it.
		- Lark does the same thing with a weed and it disintegrates as it hits the boundary.
		- Fern notes that the authors' notes did include a train around the boundary.
			- Pony tries to remember. They did mention a train, several hundred years old. There's a clipping of a news article from the Sundance library.
			- The clipping is an article about bandits having blown up the train -- a competitor of Bill McGraw's 300 years ago.
		- Reminder: Bill McGraw enforced the city of Darton with automatons and had the Church of Eve under his control. When he opened the void, a being reached out and became one with him. The few civilians who made it out of Darton said he turned into a giant, horrifying flesh amalgam
			- A Tiefling fighter, agent of Eve, became one with the Void to sacrifice this thing.
		- We consider recreating the sigil from my dream to animate the train; sigil-weaving has spoken components that we wouldn't know.
		- Lark and Jim sprint towards the train and taunt Pony by saying first one there gets the train
			- Everyone joins in sprinting towards it.
			- The civilians set up camp where we were for a bit.
		- Fern examines the bloody remains around the boundary and deduces that, whoever they were, their skeletons combusted.
		- Fern summons Goober and decides to send him into the zone.
			- He walks into the zone and out of it again.
		- We reach the train and Lark touches it first.
			- "Its MY train!!!"
			- Lark examines the train.
			- He crawls onto the train and on the other side sees a platoon (6) of Cathars.
			- "Is there a whistle here?"
				- They start prepping.
		- The train is kind of a rusty heap, but still in the general shape of a train. 300+ years old. Still good as cover.
		- Lark sprints at us, yelling "Catheters" over and over.
			- We gather and approach the train. Lark climbs among it.
			- Lark sees a chain of some sort. It's clearly a whistle thing of some sort. He pulls it immediately.
			- There's no coals or anything but a mound of sand spills out against the Cathars. Most of them are blinded but Lark is disappointed there isn't a whistle.
			- We enter initiative.
				- Fineas hops a train connector and starts slamming his pickaxe into a blinded Cathar.
				- Pony clambers onto the train and launches a Molotov at a Cathar via Catapult and hits hard
				- Al nervously gets into line of site and casts Shatter on the center of the group, hitting every Cathar while narrowly missing Fineas
				- The Cathar Fineas hit (5) bites into a green glowing pod and regains health
					- It looks similar to the fungul nodules
					- I see their veins pulse greenly
					- It hits Fienas once
				- Lark tells Carlos to shoot the one who exploded
					- The gun explodes in his hand.
				- Cathar 6 approaches me. They have short coils built into their vest.
					- It has green tubes running down its arm. It points a hand towards me and fires. I make a DEX save but get hit.
					- Lark and Pony are also in the area of effect. They both get hit.
				- Arnold fires his bolt action at 5 and misses both shots.
				- Cathar 4 also has tubes, filled with a red substance.
					- They approach me as well. They hit me with two shotgun attacks.
				- Lark shoots Cathar 3. He moves down the train and hides.
				- Cathar 2 also moves towards Fineas. This also has blood-filled tubes, red pod on his back.
					- He misses Fineas once with a point blank shotgun shot, but grazes the second.
				- Fern climbs the train and uses Moonbeam, centered on the Cathars. 3 of them fail the check.
				- Cathar 3 also nears Fineas.
					- This one punches their chest and all the tubes on their body flare and open like blood vessels to let more through. They regain health.
					- They swing at me with the butt of the shotgun. They hit one hit.
				- Cathar 1 also nears Fineas.
					- They also chomp a pod, regain health. Their fingers start to wither before it clocks me twice. I don't take muchdamage, but I feel it start to wither me. 1 turn no healing.
				- Slim Jim approaches the cluster and aims a spell at 2. They take 13 fire damage.
				- Back to FIneas. I hit the lightning Cathar (6) with my pickaxe, siccing the guardians on them and yell to Pony to "reel me behind the train"
				- Pony whips me over the train with his reel (Vortex something, I willingly fail my save). He eats a treat.
				- Al approaches the cluster of now-alone Cathars and hits them with a lvl 4 Shatter
				- Carlos tries to fix the gun. "I can't fix the gun bro"
					- He pulls out his slingshot. He misses twice.
				- Arnold misses two more shots.
				- Lark hears shouting but decides to just explore the train. He for sure finds a chest of dynamite.
					- He also infers that while the train is mostly defunct, it's somewhat operable.
					- Lark chucks a stick of dynamite at Cathar 3, who is on fire.
						- He hits, the surrounding cathars (5 & 6) fail saves and take full damage.
						- They're all bloody, 6 on death's door
				- Cathar 6 approaches Al and hits him with shocking grasp, but it only does 5 dmg due to the guardians.
				- Cathar 4 enters rage. Approaches Slim Jim and reckless attacks, hitting once. They regain hp back up to full.
				- Fern calls down lightning(?) on the group of Cathars
					- 5 is obliterated
				- Cathar 3 approaches Al
					- Takes fire damage. Regains HP. He tries to hit Al but Al ducks at the perfect moment.
				- Slim Jim heals himself. He hits Cathar 4 with Smite.
				- Fineas heal via Second Wind and run up to be next to Jim.
				- Pony casts Shatter on a sizable portion of the Cathars (2, 3, 6)
					- Cathars 6 & 2's heads explode
				- Alistair takes an opportunity attack and casts Shatter again on Cathar 4.
				- Carlos continues to try to fix the gun. Fails.
				- Arnold says ''now's my chance" and jumps off the train and aims at Cathar 4.
					- He misses his first shot, then carefully focuses on the second shot and make it, killing Cathar 4.
				- Lark decides to thrown another stick of dynamite at Cathar 3. This one is a dud and only deals bludgeoning.
					- He then immediately shoots the Cathar.
				- Fern calls lightning down on Cathar 1.
					- Cathar 3 begins to run away, dousing the fire on them. Cathar 1 joins in running
				- Fineas catches up to the two fleeing. He punches Cathar 3, killing him instantly. He missed a blow on Cathar 1.
				- Pony approaches Cathar 4's corpse and investigates.
					- The armor stuff is wired into their circulatory system. Pony considers if he could do it and comes to the conclusion that they've undergone other permanently irreversible operations impacting the function of their other bodily functions to be the way they are.
					- Some of the blood in their veins is not human. Pony takes a vial of it.
				- Alistair approaches the last Cathar and tries to hit with Firebolt.
				- Carlos tries to fix the gun again and does it!
					- "Where are they!"
				- Arnold tries to get close enough to shoot the Cathar past Slim Jim. He hits.
					- "Slim! On your left!"
					- He shoots the guy again, killing him.
			- We exit initiative.
			- Lark decides to throw an unlit stick of dynamite at Slim Jim. He succeeds.
				- It's unstable 300-year-old nitroglycerin, and it explodes.
				- Both me and Slim Jim dive out of the way, just taking half damage.
				- Lark exits the train saying he's sorry and didn't think it would explode.
			- Lark explains that there's dynamite in the train.
				- Pony investigates and gets all the unstable nitroglycerin out of the dynamite supply
				- There are 10 sticks of usable dynamite
			- Lark checks out the train more and breaks Carlos' gun again
			- Fern tells Jim about Goober being able to pass the veil and suggests he try to talk to Goober or send Megan through.
				- Jim and Fern send Goober and Megan in there and have Megan relay information to Jim.
					- "This is not a desert, babe. I'm standing on the precipice of eternity"
					- It's dark, there's floating stones, there's a spire miles away. There's abyss below.
					- They (Goober?) can hover but it's a lot of ground to cover.
					- Goober warns against Lark coming in because he'll die immediately.
					- Megan says the Cathars are in there. She doesn't know how they got in.
						- There's 10 of them in there including the Cardinal.
			- Jim translates this information.
			- Pony is investigating the train and gets a nat 20.
				- He gets everything to know about the train.
				- Animate things can be altered but not destroyed by the boundary.
				- Things of the void like Goober can enter and exit without being harmed.
				- The people who entered had some sort of regeneration ability that allowed them to get in without being destroyed.
				- Pony realizes he could fix the train within about a week. If he can imbue the train with something from Jim or Fern or something, it could enter the shell without hurting anyone inside.
				- If we all helped, including the volunteers from Bastle, we could finish the train within 3 days.
			- Slim Jim considers the situation.
				- He thinks about how he can give a part of himself to something through Lay on Hands. He thinks somehow he could help this train with something like that by building a metaphysical shield around the train. This costs health points like in the dream.
			- If Fern heals Slim Jim, we can go faster and longer.
			- Goober enters and relays that there is a cliff right past the veil. It looks like there's a city in the distance. He can't go further.
			- Pony uses the unstable dynamite to create mining explosives to aid an excavation team lead by Fineas.
			- Pony asks Arnold if he was part cow
				- "No.. Never, why?" offended
			- Pony gives the blood to Fern to see if there's anything more in it.
				- Lark gets a nat 20 medicine check on this.
				- She has spent enough time around things affected by the void that, though she can't see the cells, it flows erratically when dropped onto thing. It's some type of cow's blood tinted with the void. It causes regular tissue to regenerate.
				- It was probably taken from the Greenfang cow
			- Carlos can't get the gun to work again. Lark pretends to fix it and says to try again in 48 hours.
			- Lark cuts his leg and then tries to inject this regenerative blood where the cut is.
				- Pony thinks it might just be a carcinogen.
				- Pony doesn't tell Lark and Jim heals his wound.
			- There are some fungal pods left. Lark tries one and regains hit points. It tastes like how wet dirt smells. His veins pulse green.
				- We look at Lark's veins pulse green.
					- Fineas inspects it (nat 20)
						- The fungi, in the same way that real-life mycelium are an extant form of decay feeding on decomposition, Fineas realizes that this fungus occurredd out of a connection to the Void and feeds on that energy wherever it exists throughout Bleakburgh.
						- The fungus is basically a metaphysical decomposor
						- Lark's disks shock the fuck out of Lark.
						- It will continue to shock Lark until Lesser Restoration used; Pony does.
			- I take the remaining 2 fungal orbs after the others tell me it probably affects me more because I'm more void-attached. Save them for later.
			- We attach the cannon from Silverton to the train as well
			- We detach most of the train, leaving just the front with a cannon and enough passenger car space to fit us.
			- Kendra logs information learned and sends a letter back via bird to Silverton for the authors
			- Lark watches the skies. Natural 20 perception
				- On the horizon, he sees to the south, little dots in the sky.
				- They look neatly arranged, spread out wide. Blimps?
				- Pony tosses the telescope to Lark. They are airships.
				- They are headed not just to Bleakburgh, but specifically to Darton
- We get 1.5 days of work in. We go to sleep
	- Slim Jim, Fern, and Fineas awaken in another dream space.
		- Fern rolls Insight or Perception with help from Jim
			- Fern watches some aspect of Eve manifest.
			- She can't hear Fern.
		- Fineas gets the sense that the Fungus telling Fineas that there's something under Darton was less-so talking about an artifact.
		- The group outside sees that there is some sort of golden-white shell around the train. 
		- Those of us in the dream see the pinkie finger, healed, of the avatar of Eve touches it and converts it to bright white light.
		- The group outside see blinding white light and see steam billow out of the top. The train is already operable now.
		- Pony sees that there's a crescent of light under the eyelids of the three still asleep.
	- Lark yells for Jim to wake up. Concentration save. Fails. Jim uses Guidance to stay asleep.
	-  Success. Jim barely hears the yelling. Lark keeps trying but Pony tells him to stop and points out that the dreamers are what he thinks to be causing this.
		- Pony considers putting Lark's disks on the front of the train.
		- He tries, but he can't quite figure out how to affix them without messing with the state of the train.
	- Pony orders people in the group to get the dreamers on the train.
	- Pony and Lark are deciding who will run the train.
		- Pony will be better at it due to his Arcana skill.
		- Lark wants it because "its his train", he got there first
		- Arnold at first jokes about being on Lark's side but then gets serious and tries to convince Lark to let Arnold
	- Maisie is impressed with the work to restore the train and the magic and is awed by how close the zeppelins are.
	- Arnold tries to convince Lark to be the "CEO" of the train to let Pony do the labor
		- The only thing Lark wants to do is drive the train.
	- Pony finally agrees to simply let Lark try, he gets a negative 2.
		- Lark does the only thing he knows how to do, pull the train into gear. It speeds up.
		- The light shifts and tracks start to form in front of the train, but when Lark hits it, the train goes straight up.
			- People are thrown back, Lark is barely holding on.
		- The train narrowly avoids a zeppelin.
		- Lark hangs onto the controls as his body flaps in the wind.
	- Pony cold-cocks Lark in the back of the head. Lark flies back and hits the back.
	- Pony gets onto the controls and the train rapidly rights itself.
	- In our shared dream, the dreamers see the tiniest upturn of the mouth on the being as we are rocketed from our sleep and hit the ceiling of the train.
	- Rails build themselves through the sky in front the train as it goes, disappearing behind
	- Lark is fully unconscious on top of Maisie at the back of the train. She coughs up a little blood when he impacts her.
	- Fern looks around at the zeppelins out the window
		- Edeweidans are agape watching this train.
		- Their top researcher has been killed, they have not other word. The first thing they encounter is a flying train with a plasma cannon.
	- We discuss shooting the zeppelins.
		- Carlos takes the helm of the cannon and shoots luminescent green bullets at a zeppelin.
		- Some of the Edeweidans are trying to circle in a different direction and get on the defensive.
		- Carlos falls off.
		- Lark takes the helm of the cannon and tries to shoot them with aid from Pony's flash of genius
			- Jim tries to hold Lark still
			- Lark fires.
			- Fern makes direct eye contact as they pass. We are within 5 ft when Lark aims and fires.
			- The zeppelin fucking explodes, all of the hydrogen igniting.
			- Fern makes eye contact as they fall
	- The other zeppelins bear guns on the train.
	- Fineas looks at Maisie and asks how this is for combating the Edeweidan menace? "Cuz that's kind of your schtick huh?"
		- She is completely in awe. She has never fathomed something like this.
	- Pony is in a flow state. He has built Arnold a seatbelt, which he gives off to a kid.
	- Fern considers using magic. She realizes she can just cast lightning bolts on a zeppelin every six seconds.
		- Her hand is out the window. She points at each zeppelin, hitting them with bolts of lightning. This takes out their entire fucking fleet.
		- This is like, their entire expeditionary force.
		- One parachutes down but hits the anti-life field and they pop like a bug in a zapper.
		- An entire zeppelin decides to bail and meets this same fate.
		- The skies are clear within 10 minutes
	- The train divebombs towards the shell around Darton.
		- Pony has some doubts, asks Jim.
		- He is 100% sure
		- Pony asks Maisie if she's glad she's on our side and she's clutching on for dear life.
	- The party feels the sense of hitting a membrane as the front of the train connects with the shell
		- All of a sudden we go from pressing into a wall where the desert landscape bends, to being darkness.
			- Pony: "Everybody keep your arms, legs, and appendages inside the train at all times"
- Out the window, we see a floating, crumbling city in a vast expanse of dark.
	- We hear whale-like noises and can see the faint silhouette of something planet-sized drifting off in the dark.
	- Underneath the floating chunk of earth, we see a massive humanoid figure with pulsating green underneath. The city is built onto the shoulders of it.
	- We level up twice!!!!!!!
