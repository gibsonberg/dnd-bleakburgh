# Synopsis

- We enter scene at the outskirts of Silverton.
- Fineas spies across the outskirts of town for anywhere that looks less closely guarded
	- I notice that the Cathars are very spread apart to give the appearance of a much larger force.
	- There's like two or three of them to a stationary party and 7-8 in the moving patrols, and large swathes of alleyways that remain in the dark.
- Pony reads the lips of a patrol officer and basically just sees that they're gossipping about the Cardinal
- Fineas yells about not knowing where they're even goingas members try to ujst walk in there. This attracts the attention of some guards, forcing us to enter early without a place in mind.
- As we sneak through the town, we whisper about our options for finding the authors
	- We are finding relatively normal households as we pass
	- Lark spots a jewel-encrusted teapot with a mark of an hourglass and decides to try the door. It's locked.
		- Lark and Pony argue quietly and Lark enters the house and shuts the door behind him before Pony can get a word in
		- He smells food that remind him of his past but he doesn't dwell on it
		- He looks for people. [[Fern]] enters and Lark immediately tries to stab her with the Chimera Tooth dagger
		- She simply stops him from doing so. Lark yells for Pony, who barges through the door aiming his arm
		- Jim, who is on the roof, dives down the chimney without looking. It's lit. He falls directly into the fire, yelping.
		- Fineas is sitting against the wall of the house, humming to himself, while this is all going on.
		- Arnold walks in and Fineas follows, peaking in.
		- Lark introduces Mary and Shelley.
- Lark asks if Fern knows the other authors.
	- She does, they're down the road.
	- Pony is asking for more information about them.
	- I ask about Maisie Penn
		- She's working for the Cathars, but Fern doesn't know anything else
	- Pony asks about the teapot
		- Its a gift from the authors
- While waiting in the home, I notice:
	- Subtle, intricate hand movements in between getting ingredients for the pot.
	- She starts a fire out of nowhere with the wood stove.
		- Ask her about this later.
- Someone knocks on the door over a noise complaint.
	- Fern says she has some family over: young kid with his friends
	- Two people are at the door
	- Fern shows the number two on her hands.
	- Pony casts rope trick; he, Fineas, and Lark are sequestered within. Arnold and Jim remain.
	- Fern lets them in.
	- She successfully deceives him into thinking the kid is sleeping and not to be awoken.
- Pony reveals that he used to have kids to show condolences to Fern. She just says that hers went off to college and whatnot.
	- Pony explains why the Cathars are out for us to Fern.
	- We decide to sleep the night at Fern's -- she shows us a room and a mountain of extra blankets and pillows.
- Upon waking, I look out the window
	- There's people walking out and about. Nobody is talking very loudly, almost talking under their breath.
	- Lark wakes up looking ragged and tired.
	- Fern offers to give us food, local garb, and a letter saying she's let us pass to the authors.
- There's another knock at the door and the group argues with Lark to get him into the pocket dimension, everyone is up there.
	- This is clearly a higher-ranking officer. He asks about the people Fern had last night. The beat cop from last night was reprimanded for not getting names.
	- The interrogation does not go well.
	- Fern tangles the feet of 3 of the guards. The captain is not, and tries to draw his gun.
	- Lark is the first to drop from the pocket dimension, stabbing a guard with his Chimera dagger for 52 piercing. This kills him instantly, slashing through his entire chest.
	- Pony comes next, hitting a guard with a flaming uppercut, doing damage to the captain as well.
	- Arnold lands on the table and shoots at two people, hitting one.
	- I jump out, miss my first attack on the captain. I swing my pack back up and hook him at the shoulder, siccing the spirit guardians on him.
	- Fineas strikes the captain in the side of the head with his pickaxe, carrying him to the ground, killing him instantly, then swinging it back at the untouched guard.
	- Slim Jim takes another one out.
	- The last one gets pistol whipped by Arnold and bound to be asked questions.
- While the one guard is being interrogated, Pony rifles through the captain's belongings until he finds some letters. He finds out that Fern is on a list. He finds out that the Cathars knew we fled Sundance after our fiasco there, and also that Sundance was destroyed.
	- Lark decapitates the captain to use later for information. It's stored in the bag of holding.
- Discussing faking Fern's death by removing one of her bones, Lark suggest Fineas punch a tooth out to see if Jim can heal it. The tooth is gone and the flesh heals behind it.
- As we leave and set Fern's house on fire, she turns into a spider and hops on Slim Jim as Lark tries to stomp on her. 
- When we get to the authors' house, Fern crawls under their door (freaking them out) to let us in instead of knocking.
	- The greeting is odd, Lark immediately and repeatedly asking about Darton.
	- Lark finally gets to ask about Darton:
		- How do we get out of Darton if we enter?
			- Maybe Megan could get more information
			- Tying a rope didn't work. People could pull the rope back in its entirety, but the living being in it didn't return. DEAD LIVING THINGS ARENT AFFECTED
		- Their hypothesis: anything that can perceive things is uniquely affected by Darton
		- Is the Chrono Kid real?
			- Not sure. Rumor had to start somewhere -- it exists all over Bleakburgh.
			- Could be several people -- descriptions vary
		- Do they know a Maisie Penn?
			- Not that difficult compared to other Cathars
			- Mostly stays in one of the mansions over in the center of town.
		- Is the Darton zone boundary obvious?
			- There's a fence around it
			- Some parts of the boundary are visible, but it grows
			- We can just use the disks to tell where the boundary is
		- What do they know about the Tokwa?
			- basically what we already know
			- What about the disks?
				- Theory: somewhat like a magnet; void items item some sort of charge and the disks nullify that charge
		- Fern asks Cheryl for tools to assist in the Darton plan
			- She gives Fern the remains of their camera project for us to toy with to see if we can get working.
