# Synopsis

- Out of universe, it is confirmed that Freddy Faazbare died in the bombing of Sundance
- We spring back through the tunnels.
	- I feel the tunnels moving more than they probably should be.
	- Pony knows we can just make it if we run
	- Pony casts some message stones to tell people in the tunnels to get the prisoners we've left to flee
	- Fineas shifts Maisie's position to protect her from any falling stones.
	- Falling stalactites hit most of the party; Lark is unaffected due to a Portent
	- The tunnels begin to cave in behind us. We meet the blasted-out portion of the tunnels ahead of us.
		- Several of us are able to make it through on our own ability and through the help of others.
		- Some are teleported through.
	- The fire of Fern's teleport causes some of the party to take damage coming through the impasse.
	- We are the only ones who made it out of this exit.
- In the main chamber, Ainsley is convinced to leave with a party now to check on the people on the surface they care about.
	- Pony and Fineas concoct a plan for them to use message rocks to signal if it goes well or not by dropping them down a specified grate to a lookout person.
- We are in the cistern to rest
	- Pony dangles the Chrono Kid as Lark asks him how much money he has on him.
		- Lark searches for cash. He finds a pouch of copper.
	- Fineas asks the Chrono Kid what his actual deal is.
		- He's from Aurelon. He's an actors. He heard ab the Kid and decided to take on the role and people started believing him because he kept him out of trouble.
		- Lark tries to get him to do The Golden Saddle, one of his pulp stories
		- [[Alistaire Hayes]] is his real name
	- Talk w/ Maisie
		- Maisie expresses her disdain for how the majority of her life was all my decision. How I spent so much time working.
		- She expresses that the Cardinal was building up defenses against the coming Edeweidan invasion. He asks a lot, but people would have been safe.
			- The Edeweidan military could not risk damaging pre-calamity technology, she claims
		- She sees visions of what would happen: fire abounds
		- Fineas expresses how the Cardinal isn't really even letting them live, and this causes Maisie to go silent
		- Fineas tries to soften up to Maisie by expressing that they have a similarity: they both saw visions. They feel a pull and hear whispers. But Maisie feels compelled to work against hers due to their threat, while Fineas uses his to follow his own aims
		- She says Fineas only ever works for others, and Fineas says that maybe that's what he actually wants.
		- Maisie says its quite the gamble.
- Cut to Lark and Fern going up to the authors' house
	- Lark is freestyling
	- They make it to their house and are greeted by Jonas
		- Fern tries to make Lark apologize for what he did earlier with the chest and wall
		- She coaches him through a mostly-apology
	- Fern tries to teach Lark how to cut vegetables and things
- Cut to Slim Jim
	- Hayes kind of wants to hang out with Slim Jim a bit before he goes to sleep
		- They chat about the fact that Slim Jim is cat/two people/a god, skincare in the desert,
		- Slim-Paws Jim
	- Pony heard the whole conversation and asks Arnold how fucked up his face it
		- Arnold likes what he sees
- Cut back to Jonah's and Cheryl's
	- Fern and Lark made soup; Fern has "Basilisk Braised Chicken" as a result of a prior goof of Lark's
- WE cut to the morning in the Cistern
	- Ainsley frantically wakes Fineas to tell him that the bulk of the Eve's Cathars, including the Cardinal are heading in the general direction of Darton, presumably to get the same power we're trying to get to
	- The others in the cistern are chatting about other shit -- skincare and Pony overhearing the convo with Jim -- and Fineas is stressing about the Cathars heading directly for the thing that could end them
- We cut back to the surface.
	- The pair are saying their goodbyes to the authors
	- Fern finds out that Ainsley came by and broke the news about the Cardinal fleeing. She asks about a quick route.
	- Lark asks about whether it's possible the Cardinal is going to Bastle and what's over there
		- Bastle is a criminal holdout
- The group reunites
	- Lark suggests finding the Tokwa and getting them to help.
	- Fineas is still freaking out about getting to Darton
	- Hayes says he knows some rough-and-tumble people in Bastle
	- Ainsley gives Fern 6 Platinum the team found rifling through the Cardinal's estate as repayment for her burned down house.
	- Pony asks Ainsley for some more armor so he can eventually make half-plate
		- Bright, shiny, golden plate thing worth 400 gold pieces; Pony can make his half plate
	- Hayes states that there are rumors that come out of Bastle

- We head out to the surface

	- We find a cart and pile in; Fern wild shapes into a horse and Megan helps pull with her. The rest of us are on the horses or within the cart
	- Arnold and Hayes are up front directing.
		- Hayes has a conversation with Arnold -- mostly small talk and then about the Cow Creature in Greenfang
		- Pony listens in with Flash of Genius
	- Lark freestyles more and tries to turn it over to Maisie. She HATES him
	-  Lark starts asking people questions
		- Pony's accident is not void related

	- Fern sees a group of people standing in a circle in the desert
		- They are scantily clad and chanting something in the desert
		- Fern chats with Megan since they are both in horse form.
