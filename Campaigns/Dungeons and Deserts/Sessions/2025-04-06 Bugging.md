# Synopsis

- We enter into the battle with the beetle
	- Perception check: 
		- Pony and Fern hear that the people in a semicircle are chanting
			- Pony sees they are saying "let the hungry one come before us" via reading lips
	- Upon it erupting into battle, the horses begin to steer the cart around
	- The people around the bug allow it to eat them
		- The ones that remain begin chanting something new
	- The cart is rolled out a bit further
		- We feel the bug getting closer
		- The bug hits the cart
		- The wind of the bug's body slam causes wheels to pop off the cart
		- I almost fall out of the cart but just barely catch myself, taking some damage
			- Maisie almost falls out of the cart, but I barely grab her. She also takes some damage and spits a little blood
		- Lark bails deftly
		- Pony manages to bail as well, Arnold tries to follow but is caught by torn cloth and falls out
- We enter combat
	- Slim Jim mounts Megan and rides over to start smashing the beetle
		- Does 40 damage!!!!
	- I leave Maisie in the cart and run over to hit the beetle before running away.
		- It takes the pickaxe like a metal wall
		- It reaction attacks me as I run away
	- Fern drags the cart further yet before leaving horse form
		- She argues with Al about whether or not he should fight the bug
		- She tries to make sure he watches Maisie; he agrees and gets in the cart
		- Fern casts moon beam on the bug
	- Lark shoots the bug in one of its eyes
	- Al is bugging Maisie in an attempt to be polite company
	- Pony creates 3 mirror images of himself
	- Arnold flanks the bug and chucks a stick of dynamite at the bug
		- Shell fragments fly off like shrapnel
	- The beetle begins to burrow and is hit by the moon beam.
		- It is under the ground. 
		- It burrows towards Slim Jim. It tries to slap Jim and Megan with its wings from below.
		- Jim is launched 10 feet in the air
			- Megan is dispersed
	- Jim has just landed. Jim has no clue where the beetle is.
		- Jim heals him self
	- I look for the bug
		- I feel it just under my feet. Within 5 feet
		- I deliberately bait it out of the sand and take a hit to re-up my rage
		- I punch it and rip out some of its guts. I try to punch it again and miss.
	- Fern runs to Lark
		- Fern tries to get an idea of what Lark's plan is and he's just like "I shoot it."
		- She moves the moon beam
	- Lark aims at the bug and gets a critical hit.
	- Al is still trying to speak with Maisie.
	- Pony hits it with a wave of thunder.
	- Arnold tries to shoot the bug, missing twice.
	- The beetle starts heading for the caravan
		- It passes under Pony, who tries to hit it with a wave of thunder
		- The bug stumbles for a bit before continuing.
		- It does not recharge its wing attack, but tries to snap up with its mandibles
		- Al, as a held action, picks Maisie up and moves her out of the cart
			- He dive-rolls out of the caravan, successfully avoiding its mandible attack
		- It hits the cart, shattering the back half
	- Jim rocks up to the bug and hits it with another smite
	- Fineas moves between the bug and Maisie
	- Fern tries to ask Lark if he thinks the beetle will understand if she heals it.
		- She moves the beam, killing the bug
		- She's annoyed and barely paying attention as she causes holes to litter the bug's carapace
		- The bug collapses
- There are still half of the group of people, 400 ft away.
	- They haven't moved at all. They are watching, seemingly.
		- They seem pretty unphased
- Lark notices there are 4 Pony Harragans and tries to shoot one. He misses while Pony eggs him on and Arnold gets mad. He hits all three of the duplicates.
- Fineas turns to Al and Maisie to check on them.
	- Maisie is shocked for a moment and once she notices I've perceived her, she forces herself to show no emotion like she has been.
	- I don't mention it.
- Pony uses some of the chitin to further improve the armor set that he's been working on.
	- This grants it an additional +1 to AC
- We argue about bug guts and Al's voice as Jim marches onwards towards the remaining cultists?
	- They are astounded by how "the beast" (Jim) walks
	- They are shirtless but not full on naked
	- They have white powder painted all over their body in various patterns
	- Pony copies their markings with his illusory abilities
	- They are astonished he defeated the hungry one, the beam from the sky
	- Jim asks what they're doing out here
		- They're in the desert to give thanks to the beasts that protect them
		- They're okay with the fact that it ate some of them because it has to feed
	- Jim asks if they can summon another hungry one
- Part of the group continues to discuss cooking the bug and hoping it tastes like shrimps.

		- Pony and Fern get really into cooking it with the spices they have available
- Lark and Fineas approach Jim
	- Jim calls us his disciples, the group believes him
	- Lark is initially hostile to the idea bc Jim mentions having the group summon a new bug, but Slim Jim gets him to quiet down
	- They say when they summon them sometimes they show up sometimes not
		- 3 of 9 times???
	- They don't wear clothes on to be closer to nature
	- They are exceedingly happy to join us for bug meat
- We walk back towards the camp
	- Lark is considering cutting down the group of 10 cultists to 4? maybe? and asks every one of their names
	- We learn that there's like 30 of them back in their encampment
	- We convince them to commit themselves to slaying the Cardinal

- We decide to set up camp for the night to get a long rest.
	- Fern has a conversation with Al to reset their relations, they agree to cook more

		- He can see the group walking away on the horizon.
		- He hears Al tossing and turning as if he's having a nightmare about someone torturing him for money
			- Lark whispers mean things in his ear as he sleeps
			- He says he's coming back to Bastle and he'll have it soon
		- Lark places Al's hand in water in an effort to get him to pee himself
			- He thinks so hard about him pissing himself that Lark pisses himself a little
	- Lark wakes Arnold and tries to convince him that he didn't piss himself
		- Lark drops his pants and underwear completely in front of Arnold
		- He waddles over to his bedroll with his pants around his legs, and only takes them completely off after Arnold yells after him
		- Arnold is so exhausted by this Lark overstimulating him that he just doesn't see anything of interest
	- Arnold goes to wake Al in an effort to let Pony sleep
		- Al hadn't pissed himself.
		- His watch passes uneventfully.
	- Al wakes Fineas
		- I don't see shit.
	- Morning comes and everybody wakes up
		- Lark is notably pantsless
		- Pony makes fun of Lark a bit too much and Lark starts pissing while running towards Pony
		- Lark brings up Al talking in his sleep about his debts in Bastle

	- Lark discusses the possibility of writing a play and takes the pen name "Billy Joel"

		- It's larger than Greenfang, significantly smaller than Sundance
		- The sheriff's office has been repurposed by criminals
	- Al's gambling debt is from Aurelon; people followed him out here
		- He was a victim of a game fixed against his favor
	- As we enter town we briefly discuss the Maisie issue
