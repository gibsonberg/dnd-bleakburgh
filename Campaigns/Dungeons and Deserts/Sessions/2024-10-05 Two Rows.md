# Synopsis

[[Fineas Penn]], upon seeing an eye peering through the boards of the building that the group was camping in before the owner ran, begins frantically waking up [[Harrigan-Penn Party]]. [[Pony Harrigan]] gets a view of the person who was watching them. He aims his arm at him, but doesn't take the shot. The group marches after the man, who is panting and flailing as he sprints as fast as he can through the town. Eventually, the group turns a corner and comes face-to-face with the [[Greenfang Patrol]].

At first, the Patrol takes a hostile stance towards the party, though the tension is eventually relieved through the party (especially [[Lark]]) making fools of themselves and offering resources. Notably, [[Deputy Arnold]] was receptive to receiving water brewed by Pony in exchange for safe passage and lodging. The Patrol took the party to a boarded-up [[Greenfang#The Tavern|tavern]] where the party would stay, and where Pony could begin purifying water.

While at the tavern, Lark repeatedly gets into trouble with various teenage pranks. While doing so, [[Slim Jim]] and [[Fineas Penn]] are given a tour of the [[Greenfang#Underground Tunnels|tunnels underneath Greenfang]], in particular, the milk storage room, which is remarkably cold for its depth. Slim Jim and Fineas negotiate a large supply of fermented milk ("Two rows for the cat!") in exchange for the water being brewed in that moment by Pony. As they return to the tavern, Arnold witnesses one of Lark's pranks which results in James being held in the air by a misfired spell by Pony, as well as the replacement of a shotgun with a drawing of a penis.

As the night grows long, Pony (himself bisexual) becomes aware that Arnold is gay and there is clear awkwardness and tension between them. Eventually, Arnold needs to leave, and locks the party in the tavern using a wooden bar as he leaves. Immediately upon Arnold and the Patrol leaving, the party opens the door, breaking the bar in the process. Lark and Slim Jim catch faint distressed mooing in the distance, and the party follows.

The party comes across a boarded-up [[Greenfang#Industrial Building|industrial building]], where the mooing is obvious to the rest of the party. They discuss their next actions, eventually deciding to climb onto the roof and crawl through the vents to get inside. [[Lark#Mary and Shelly|Mary and Shelley]] scout the vents first, but are lost, compelling the rest of the party to hop in to search. Through various grates, the party see the [[Cow Creature]] and an [[Cow Creature#Harvesters|organized group of people]] harvesting milk and other resources from it. They decide that there's clearly too many people and no good ways to approach this, and leave back the way they came. Upon returning to the tavern, Pony rebuilds the bar with the aid of Slim Jim and Fineas before using his detachable hand to place it back on the outside of the door.

As the party sleeps in shifts throughout the night, it becomes clear that the Patrol had been intermittently checking in on them. Upon waking, Arnold and Pony decide to go on their own "tour" of the tunnels underneath the town.
