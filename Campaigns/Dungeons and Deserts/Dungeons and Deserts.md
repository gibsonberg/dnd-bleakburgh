# Synopsis

[[Fineas Penn]] and [[Pony Harrigan]] set out from [[Sundance]] in search of a rare artifact necessary for one of Pony's ongoing projects. Their mission is quickly interrupted by the anthropomorphic cat [[Slim Jim]] and child-rogue [[Lark]]. As the mission for the artifact goes awry, the four decide to stick together for survival, leading them to the place the world ended decades ago.
